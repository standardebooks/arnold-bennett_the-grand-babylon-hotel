<h2>
      Chapter One THE MILLIONAIRE AND THE WAITER
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘YES, sir?’
    </p>
<p>
      Jules, the celebrated head waiter of the Grand Babylon, was bending
      formally towards the alert, middle-aged man who had just entered the
      smoking-room and dropped into a basket-chair in the corner by the
      conservatory. It was 7.45 on a particularly sultry June night, and dinner
      was about to be served at the Grand Babylon. Men of all sizes, ages, and
      nationalities, but every one alike arrayed in faultless evening dress,
      were dotted about the large, dim apartment. A faint odour of flowers came
      from the conservatory, and the tinkle of a fountain. The waiters,
      commanded by Jules, moved softly across the thick Oriental rugs, balancing
      their trays with the dexterity of jugglers, and receiving and executing
      orders with that air of profound importance of which only really
      first-class waiters have the secret. The atmosphere was an atmosphere of
      serenity and repose, characteristic of the Grand Babylon. It seemed
      impossible that anything could occur to mar the peaceful, aristocratic
      monotony of existence in that perfectly-managed establishment. Yet on that
      night was to happen the mightiest upheaval that the Grand Babylon had ever
      known.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, sir?’ repeated Jules, and this time there was a shade of august
      disapproval in his voice: it was not usual for him to have to address a
      customer twice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh!’ said the alert, middle-aged man, looking up at length. Beautifully
      ignorant of the identity of the great Jules, he allowed his grey eyes to
      twinkle as he caught sight of the expression on the waiter’s face. ‘Bring
      me an Angel Kiss.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pardon, sir?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Bring me an Angel Kiss, and be good enough to lose no time.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If it’s an American drink, I fear we don’t keep it, sir.’ The voice of
      Jules fell icily distinct, and several men glanced round uneasily, as if
      to deprecate the slightest disturbance of their calm. The appearance of
      the person to whom Jules was speaking, however, reassured them somewhat,
      for he had all the look of that expert, the travelled Englishman, who can
      differentiate between one hotel and another by instinct, and who knows at
      once where he may make a fuss with propriety, and where it is advisable to
      behave exactly as at the club. The Grand Babylon was a hotel in whose
      smoking-room one behaved as though one was at one’s club.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I didn’t suppose you did keep it, but you can mix it, I guess, even in
      this hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This isn’t an American hotel, sir.’ The calculated insolence of the words
      was cleverly masked beneath an accent of humble submission.
    </p>
<p>
      The alert, middle-aged man sat up straight, and gazed placidly at Jules,
      who was pulling his famous red side-whiskers.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Get a liqueur glass,’ he said, half curtly and half with good-humoured
      tolerance, ‘pour into it equal quantities of maraschino, cream, and crême
      de menthe. Don’t stir it; don’t shake it. Bring it to me. And, I say, tell
      the bar-tender—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Bar-tender, sir?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tell the bar-tender to make a note of the recipe, as I shall probably
      want an Angel Kiss every evening before dinner so long as this weather
      lasts.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will send the drink to you, sir,’ said Jules distantly. That was his
      parting shot, by which he indicated that he was not as other waiters are,
      and that any person who treated him with disrespect did so at his own
      peril.
    </p>
<p>
      A few minutes later, while the alert, middle-aged man was tasting the
      Angel Kiss, Jules sat in conclave with Miss Spencer, who had charge of the
      bureau of the Grand Babylon. This bureau was a fairly large chamber, with
      two sliding glass partitions which overlooked the entrance-hall and the
      smoking-room. Only a small portion of the clerical work of the great hotel
      was performed there. The place served chiefly as the lair of Miss Spencer,
      who was as well known and as important as Jules himself. Most modern
      hotels have a male clerk to superintend the bureau. But the Grand Babylon
      went its own way. Miss Spencer had been bureau clerk almost since the
      Grand Babylon had first raised its massive chimneys to heaven, and she
      remained in her place despite the vagaries of other hotels. Always
      admirably dressed in plain black silk, with a small diamond brooch,
      immaculate wrist-bands, and frizzed yellow hair, she looked now just as
      she had looked an indefinite number of years ago. Her age—none knew
      it, save herself and perhaps one other, and none cared. The gracious and
      alluring contours of her figure were irreproachable; and in the evenings
      she was a useful ornament of which any hotel might be innocently proud.
      Her knowledge of Bradshaw, of steamship services, and the programmes of
      theatres and music-halls was unrivalled; yet she never travelled, she
      never went to a theatre or a music-hall. She seemed to spend the whole of
      her life in that official lair of hers, imparting information to guests,
      telephoning to the various departments, or engaged in intimate
      conversations with her special friends on the staff, as at present.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who’s Number 107?’ Jules asked this black-robed lady.
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer examined her ledgers.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Theodore Racksole, New York.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I thought he must be a New Yorker,’ said Jules, after a brief,
      significant pause, ‘but he talks as good English as you or me. Says he
      wants an “Angel Kiss”—maraschino and cream, if you please—every
      night. I’ll see he doesn’t stop here too long.’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer smiled grimly in response. The notion of referring to
      Theodore Racksole as a ‘New Yorker’ appealed to her sense of humour, a
      sense in which she was not entirely deficient. She knew, of course, and
      she knew that Jules knew, that this Theodore Racksole must be the unique
      and only Theodore Racksole, the third richest man in the United States,
      and therefore probably in the world. Nevertheless she ranged herself at
      once on the side of Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      Just as there was only one Racksole, so there was only one Jules, and Miss
      Spencer instinctively shared the latter’s indignation at the spectacle of
      any person whatsoever, millionaire or Emperor, presuming to demand an
      ‘Angel Kiss’, that unrespectable concoction of maraschino and cream,
      within the precincts of the Grand Babylon. In the world of hotels it was
      currently stated that, next to the proprietor, there were three gods at
      the Grand Babylon—Jules, the head waiter, Miss Spencer, and, most
      powerful of all, Rocco, the renowned chef, who earned two thousand a year,
      and had a chalet on the Lake of Lucerne. All the great hotels in
      Northumberland Avenue and on the Thames Embankment had tried to get Rocco
      away from the Grand Babylon, but without success. Rocco was well aware
      that even he could rise no higher than the maître d’hotel of the Grand
      Babylon, which, though it never advertised itself, and didn’t belong to a
      limited company, stood an easy first among the hotels of Europe—first
      in expensiveness, first in exclusiveness, first in that mysterious quality
      known as ‘style’.
    </p>
<p>
      Situated on the Embankment, the Grand Babylon, despite its noble
      proportions, was somewhat dwarfed by several colossal neighbours. It had
      but three hundred and fifty rooms, whereas there are two hotels within a
      quarter of a mile with six hundred and four hundred rooms respectively. On
      the other hand, the Grand Babylon was the only hotel in London with a
      genuine separate entrance for Royal visitors constantly in use. The Grand
      Babylon counted that day wasted on which it did not entertain, at the
      lowest, a German prince or the Maharajah of some Indian State. When Felix
      Babylon—after whom, and not with any reference to London’s nickname,
      the hotel was christened—when Felix Babylon founded the hotel in
      1869 he had set himself to cater for Royalty, and that was the secret of
      his triumphant eminence.
    </p>
<p>
      The son of a rich Swiss hotel proprietor and financier, he had contrived
      to established a connection with the officials of several European Courts,
      and he had not spared money in that respect. Sundry kings and not a few
      princesses called him Felix, and spoke familiarly of the hotel as
      ‘Felix’s’; and Felix had found that this was very good for trade. The
      Grand Babylon was managed accordingly. The ‘note’ of its policy was
      discretion, always discretion, and quietude, simplicity, remoteness. The
      place was like a palace incognito. There was no gold sign over the roof,
      not even an explanatory word at the entrance. You walked down a small side
      street off the Strand, you saw a plain brown building in front of you,
      with two mahogany swing doors, and an official behind each; the doors
      opened noiselessly; you entered; you were in Felix’s. If you meant to be a
      guest, you, or your courier, gave your card to Miss Spencer. Upon no
      consideration did you ask for the tariff. It was not good form to mention
      prices at the Grand Babylon; the prices were enormous, but you never
      mentioned them. At the conclusion of your stay a bill was presented, brief
      and void of dry details, and you paid it without a word. You met with a
      stately civility, that was all. No one had originally asked you to come;
      no one expressed the hope that you would come again. The Grand Babylon was
      far above such manoeuvres; it defied competition by ignoring it; and
      consequently was nearly always full during the season.
    </p>
<p>
      If there was one thing more than another that annoyed the Grand Babylon—put
      its back up, so to speak—it was to be compared with, or to be
      mistaken for, an American hotel. The Grand Babylon was resolutely opposed
      to American methods of eating, drinking, and lodging—but especially
      American methods of drinking. The resentment of Jules, on being requested
      to supply Mr Theodore Racksole with an Angel Kiss, will therefore be
      appreciated.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Anybody with Mr Theodore Racksole?’ asked Jules, continuing his
      conversation with Miss Spencer. He put a scornful stress on every syllable
      of the guest’s name.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Racksole—she’s in No. 111.’
    </p>
<p>
      Jules paused, and stroked his left whisker as it lay on his gleaming white
      collar.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She’s where?’ he queried, with a peculiar emphasis.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No. 111. I couldn’t help it. There was no other room with a bathroom and
      dressing-room on that floor.’ Miss Spencer’s voice had an appealing tone
      of excuse.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why didn’t you tell Mr Theodore Racksole and Miss Racksole that we were
      unable to accommodate them?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because Babs was within hearing.’
    </p>
<p>
      Only three people in the wide world ever dreamt of applying to Mr Felix
      Babylon the playful but mean abbreviation—Babs: those three were
      Jules, Miss Spencer, and Rocco. Jules had invented it. No one but he would
      have had either the wit or the audacity to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’d better see that Miss Racksole changes her room to-night,’ Jules
      said after another pause. ‘Leave it to me: I’ll fix it. Au revoir! It’s
      three minutes to eight. I shall take charge of the dining-room myself
      to-night.’
    </p>
<p>
      And Jules departed, rubbing his fine white hands slowly and meditatively.
      It was a trick of his, to rub his hands with a strange, roundabout motion,
      and the action denoted that some unusual excitement was in the air.
    </p>
<p>
      At eight o’clock precisely dinner was served in the immense salle Ã  manger,
      that chaste yet splendid apartment of white and gold. At a small table
      near one of the windows a young lady sat alone. Her frocks said Paris, but
      her face unmistakably said New York. It was a self-possessed and
      bewitching face, the face of a woman thoroughly accustomed to doing
      exactly what she liked, when she liked, how she liked: the face of a woman
      who had taught hundreds of gilded young men the true art of fetching and
      carrying, and who, by twenty years or so of parental spoiling, had come to
      regard herself as the feminine equivalent of the Tsar of All the Russias.
      Such women are only made in America, and they only come to their full
      bloom in Europe, which they imagine to be a continent created by
      Providence for their diversion.
    </p>
<p>
      The young lady by the window glanced disapprovingly at the menu card. Then
      she looked round the dining-room, and, while admiring the diners, decided
      that the room itself was rather small and plain. Then she gazed through
      the open window, and told herself that though the Thames by twilight was
      passable enough, it was by no means level with the Hudson, on whose shores
      her father had a hundred thousand dollar country cottage. Then she
      returned to the menu, and with a pursing of lovely lips said that there
      appeared to be nothing to eat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sorry to keep you waiting, Nella.’ It was Mr Racksole, the intrepid
      millionaire who had dared to order an Angel Kiss in the smoke-room of the
      Grand Babylon. Nella—her proper name was Helen—smiled at her
      parent cautiously, reserving to herself the right to scold if she should
      feel so inclined.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You always are late, father,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only on a holiday,’ he added. ‘What is there to eat?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then let’s have it. I’m hungry. I’m never so hungry as when I’m being
      seriously idle.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Consommé Britannia,’ she began to read out from the menu, ‘Saumon
      d’Ecosse, Sauce Genoise, Aspics de Homard. Oh, heavens! Who wants these
      horrid messes on a night like this?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But, Nella, this is the best cooking in Europe,’ he protested.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Say, father,’ she said, with seeming irrelevance, ‘had you forgotten it’s
      my birthday to-morrow?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have I ever forgotten your birthday, O most costly daughter?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On the whole you’ve been a most satisfactory dad,’ she answered sweetly,
      ‘and to reward you I’ll be content this year with the cheapest birthday
      treat you ever gave me. Only I’ll have it to-night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ he said, with the long-suffering patience, the readiness for any
      surprise, of a parent whom Nella had thoroughly trained, ‘what is it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s this. Let’s have filleted steak and a bottle of Bass for dinner
      to-night. It will be simply exquisite. I shall love it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But my dear Nella,’ he exclaimed, ‘steak and beer at Felix’s! It’s
      impossible! Moreover, young women still under twenty-three cannot be
      permitted to drink Bass.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I said steak and Bass, and as for being twenty-three, shall be going in
      twenty-four to-morrow.’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Racksole set her small white teeth.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a gentle cough. Jules stood over them. It must have been out of
      a pure spirit of adventure that he had selected this table for his own
      services. Usually Jules did not personally wait at dinner. He merely
      hovered observant, like a captain on the bridge during the mate’s watch.
      Regular frequenters of the hotel felt themselves honoured when Jules
      attached himself to their tables.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole hesitated one second, and then issued the order with a
      fine air of carelessness:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Filleted steak for two, and a bottle of Bass.’ It was the bravest act of
      Theodore Racksole’s life, and yet at more than one previous crisis a high
      courage had not been lacking to him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s not in the menu, sir,’ said Jules the imperturbable.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never mind. Get it. We want it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Very good, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      Jules walked to the service-door, and, merely affecting to look behind,
      came immediately back again.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Rocco’s compliments, sir, and he regrets to be unable to serve steak
      and Bass to-night, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Rocco?’ questioned Racksole lightly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Rocco,’ repeated Jules with firmness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And who is Mr Rocco?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Rocco is our chef, sir.’ Jules had the expression of a man who is
      asked to explain who Shakespeare was.
    </p>
<p>
      The two men looked at each other. It seemed incredible that Theodore
      Racksole, the ineffable Racksole, who owned a thousand miles of railway,
      several towns, and sixty votes in Congress, should be defied by a waiter,
      or even by a whole hotel. Yet so it was. When Europe’s effete back is
      against the wall not a regiment of millionaires can turn its flank. Jules
      had the calm expression of a strong man sure of victory. His face said:
      ‘You beat me once, but not this time, my New York friend!’
    </p>
<p>
      As for Nella, knowing her father, she foresaw interesting events, and
      waited confidently for the steak. She did not feel hungry, and she could
      afford to wait.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Excuse me a moment, Nella,’ said Theodore Racksole quietly, ‘I shall be
      back in about two seconds,’ and he strode out of the salle Ã  manger. No
      one in the room recognized the millionaire, for he was unknown to London,
      this being his first visit to Europe for over twenty years. Had anyone
      done so, and caught the expression on his face, that man might have
      trembled for an explosion which should have blown the entire Grand Babylon
      into the Thames.
    </p>
<p>
      Jules retired strategically to a corner. He had fired; it was the
      antagonist’s turn. A long and varied experience had taught Jules that a
      guest who embarks on the subjugation of a waiter is almost always lost;
      the waiter has so many advantages in such a contest.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Two HOW MR RACKSOLE OBTAINED HIS DINNER
    </h2>
<p>
      NEVERTHELESS, there are men with a confirmed habit of getting their own
      way, even as guests in an exclusive hotel: and Theodore Racksole had long
      since fallen into that useful practice—except when his only daughter
      Helen, motherless but high-spirited girl, chose to think that his way
      crossed hers, in which case Theodore capitulated and fell back. But when
      Theodore and his daughter happened to be going one and the same road,
      which was pretty often, then Heaven alone might help any obstacle that was
      so ill-advised as to stand in their path. Jules, great and observant man
      though he was, had not noticed the terrible projecting chins of both
      father and daughter, otherwise it is possible he would have reconsidered
      the question of the steak and Bass.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole went direct to the entrance-hall of the hotel, and
      entered Miss Spencer’s sanctum.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want to see Mr Babylon,’ he said, ‘without the delay of an instant.’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer leisurely raised her flaxen head.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am afraid—,’ she began the usual formula. It was part of her
      daily duty to discourage guests who desired to see Mr Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, no,’ said Racksole quickly, ‘I don’t want any “I’m afraids.” This is
      business. If you had been the ordinary hotel clerk I should have slipped
      you a couple of sovereigns into your hand, and the thing would have been
      done.
    </p>
<p>
      As you are not—as you are obviously above bribes—I merely say
      to you, I must see Mr Babylon at once on an affair of the utmost urgency.
      My name is Racksole—Theodore Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of New York?’ questioned a voice at the door, with a slight foreign
      accent.
    </p>
<p>
      The millionaire turned sharply, and saw a rather short, French-looking
      man, with a bald head, a grey beard, a long and perfectly-built frock
      coat, eye-glasses attached to a minute silver chain, and blue eyes that
      seemed to have the transparent innocence of a maid’s.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is only one,’ said Theodore Racksole succinctly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You wish to see me?’ the new-comer suggested.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are Mr Felix Babylon?’
    </p>
<p>
      The man bowed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘At this moment I wish to see you more than anyone else in the world,’
      said Racksole. ‘I am consumed and burnt up with a desire to see you, Mr
      Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      I only want a few minutes’ quiet chat. I fancy I can settle my business in
      that time.’
    </p>
<p>
      With a gesture Mr Babylon invited the millionaire down a side corridor, at
      the end of which was Mr Babylon’s private room, a miracle of Louis XV
      furniture and tapestry: like most unmarried men with large incomes, Mr
      Babylon had ‘tastes’ of a highly expensive sort.
    </p>
<p>
      The landlord and his guest sat down opposite each other. Theodore Racksole
      had met with the usual millionaire’s luck in this adventure, for Mr
      Babylon made a practice of not allowing himself to be interviewed by his
      guests, however distinguished, however wealthy, however pertinacious. If
      he had not chanced to enter Miss Spencer’s office at that precise moment,
      and if he had not been impressed in a somewhat peculiar way by the
      physiognomy of the millionaire, not all Mr Racksole’s American energy and
      ingenuity would have availed for a confabulation with the owner of the
      Grand Babylon HÃ´tel that night. Theodore Racksole, however, was ignorant
      that a mere accident had served him. He took all the credit to himself.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I read in the New York papers some months ago,’ Theodore started, without
      even a clearing of the throat, ‘that this hotel of yours, Mr Babylon, was
      to be sold to a limited company, but it appears that the sale was not
      carried out.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It was not,’ answered Mr Babylon frankly, ‘and the reason was that the
      middle-men between the proposed company and myself wished to make a large
      secret profit, and I declined to be a party to such a profit. They were
      firm; I was firm; and so the affair came to nothing.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The agreed price was satisfactory?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Quite.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May I ask what the price was?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you a buyer, Mr Racksole?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you a seller, Mr Babylon?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am,’ said Babylon, ‘on terms. The price was four hundred thousand
      pounds, including the leasehold and goodwill. But I sell only on the
      condition that the buyer does not transfer the property to a limited
      company at a higher figure.’

<p>
      ‘I will put one question to you, Mr Babylon,’ said the millionaire. ‘What
      have your profits averaged during the last four years?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thirty-four thousand pounds per annum.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I buy,’ said Theodore Racksole, smiling contentedly; ‘and we will, if you
      please, exchange contract-letters on the spot.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You come quickly to a resolution, Mr Racksole. But perhaps you have been
      considering this question for a long time?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On the contrary,’ Racksole looked at his watch, ‘I have been considering
      it for six minutes.’
    </p>
<p>
      Felix Babylon bowed, as one thoroughly accustomed to eccentricity of
      wealth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The beauty of being well-known,’ Racksole continued, ‘is that you needn’t
      trouble about preliminary explanations. You, Mr Babylon, probably know all
      about me. I know a good deal about you. We can take each other for granted
      without reference. Really, it is as simple to buy an hotel or a railroad
      as it is to buy a watch, provided one is equal to the transaction.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Precisely,’ agreed Mr Babylon smiling. ‘Shall we draw up the little
      informal contract? There are details to be thought of. But it occurs to me
      that you cannot have dined yet, and might prefer to deal with minor
      questions after dinner.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have not dined,’ said the millionaire, with emphasis, ‘and in that
      connexion will you do me a favour? Will you send for Mr Rocco?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You wish to see him, naturally.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do,’ said the millionaire, and added, ‘about my dinner.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rocco is a great man,’ murmured Mr Babylon as he touched the bell,
      ignoring the last words. ‘My compliments to Mr Rocco,’ he said to the page
      who answered his summons, ‘and if it is quite convenient I should be glad
      to see him here for a moment.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you give Rocco?’ Racksole inquired.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Two thousand a year and the treatment of an Ambassador.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall give him the treatment of an Ambassador and three thousand.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will be wise,’ said Felix Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      At that moment Rocco came into the room, very softly—a man of forty,
      thin, with long, thin hands, and an inordinately long brown silky
      moustache.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rocco,’ said Felix Babylon, ‘let me introduce Mr Theodore Racksole, of
      New York.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sharmed,’ said Rocco, bowing. ‘Ze—ze, vat you call it,
      millionaire?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Exactly,’ Racksole put in, and continued quickly: ‘Mr Rocco, I wish to
      acquaint you before any other person with the fact that I have purchased
      the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel. If you think well to afford me the privilege of
      retaining your services I shall be happy to offer you a remuneration of
      three thousand a year.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tree, you said?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Three.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sharmed.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now, Mr Rocco, will you oblige me very much by ordering a plain
      beefsteak and a bottle of Bass to be served by Jules—I particularly
      desire Jules—at table No. 17 in the dining-room in ten minutes from
      now? And will you do me the honour of lunching with me to-morrow?’
    </p>
<p>
      Mr Rocco gasped, bowed, muttered something in French, and departed.
    </p>
<p>
      Five minutes later the buyer and seller of the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel had
      each signed a curt document, scribbled out on the hotel note-paper. Felix
      Babylon asked no questions, and it was this heroic absence of curiosity,
      of surprise on his part, that more than anything else impressed Theodore
      Racksole. How many hotel proprietors in the world, Racksole asked himself,
      would have let that beef-steak and Bass go by without a word of comment.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘From what date do you wish the purchase to take effect?’ asked Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh,’ said Racksole lightly, ‘it doesn’t matter. Shall we say from
      to-night?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As you will. I have long wished to retire. And now that the moment has
      come—and so dramatically—I am ready. I shall return to
      Switzerland. One cannot spend much money there, but it is my native land.
      I shall be the richest man in Switzerland.’ He smiled with a kind of sad
      amusement.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose you are fairly well off?’ said Racksole, in that easy familiar
      style of his, as though the idea had just occurred to him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Besides what I shall receive from you, I have half a million invested.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you will be nearly a millionaire?’
    </p>
<p>
      Felix Babylon nodded.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I congratulate you, my dear sir,’ said Racksole, in the tone of a judge
      addressing a newly-admitted barrister. ‘Nine hundred thousand pounds,
      expressed in francs, will sound very nice—in Switzerland.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of course to you, Mr Racksole, such a sum would be poverty. Now if one
      might guess at your own wealth?’ Felix Babylon was imitating the other’s
      freedom.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not know, to five millions or so, what I am worth,’ said Racksole,
      with sincerity, his tone indicating that he would have been glad to give
      the information if it were in his power.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have had anxieties, Mr Racksole?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Still have them. I am now holiday-making in London with my daughter in
      order to get rid of them for a time.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is the purchase of hotels your notion of relaxation, then?’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole shrugged his shoulders. ‘It is a change from railroads,’ he
      laughed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah, my friend, you little know what you have bought.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! yes I do,’ returned Racksole; ‘I have bought just the first hotel in
      the world.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is true, that is true,’ Babylon admitted, gazing meditatively at the
      antique Persian carpet. ‘There is nothing, anywhere, like my hotel. But
      you will regret the purchase, Mr Racksole. It is no business of mine, of
      course, but I cannot help repeating that you will regret the purchase.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I never regret.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you will begin very soon—perhaps to-night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why do you say that?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because the Grand Babylon is the Grand Babylon. You think because you
      control a railroad, or an iron-works, or a line of steamers, therefore you
      can control anything. But no. Not the Grand Babylon. There is something
      about the Grand Babylon—’ He threw up his hands.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Servants rob you, of course.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of course. I suppose I lose a hundred pounds a week in that way. But it
      is not that I mean. It is the guests. The guests are too—too
      distinguished.
    </p>
<p>
      The great Ambassadors, the great financiers, the great nobles, all the men
      that move the world, put up under my roof. London is the centre of
      everything, and my hotel—your hotel—is the centre of London.
      Once I had a King and a Dowager Empress staying here at the same time.
      Imagine that!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A great honour, Mr Babylon. But wherein lies the difficulty?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Racksole,’ was the grim reply, ‘what has become of your shrewdness—that
      shrewdness which has made your fortune so immense that even you cannot
      calculate it? Do you not perceive that the roof which habitually shelters
      all the force, all the authority of the world, must necessarily also
      shelter nameless and numberless plotters, schemers, evil-doers, and
      workers of mischief? The thing is as clear as day—and as dark as
      night. Mr Racksole, I never know by whom I am surrounded. I never know
      what is going forward.
    </p>
<p>
      Only sometimes I get hints, glimpses of strange acts and strange secrets.
    </p>
<p>
      You mentioned my servants. They are almost all good servants, skilled,
      competent. But what are they besides? For anything I know my fourth
      sub-chef may be an agent of some European Government. For anything I know
      my invaluable Miss Spencer may be in the pay of a court dressmaker or a
      Frankfort banker. Even Rocco may be someone else in addition to Rocco.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That makes it all the more interesting,’ remarked Theodore Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What a long time you have been, Father,’ said Nella, when he returned to
      table No. 17 in the salle Ã  manger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only twenty minutes, my dove.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you said two seconds. There is a difference.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, you see, I had to wait for the steak to cook.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did you have much trouble in getting my birthday treat?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No trouble. But it didn’t come quite as cheap as you said.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you mean, Father?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only that I’ve bought the entire hotel. But don’t split.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father, you always were a delicious parent. Shall you give me the hotel
      for a birthday present?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No. I shall run it—as an amusement. By the way, who is that chair
      for?’
    </p>
<p>
      He noticed that a third cover had been laid at the table.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is for a friend of mine who came in about five minutes ago. Of
      course I told him he must share our steak. He’ll be here in a moment.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May I respectfully inquire his name?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dimmock—Christian name Reginald; profession, English companion to
      Prince Aribert of Posen. I met him when I was in St Petersburg with cousin
      Hetty last fall. Oh; here he is. Mr Dimmock, this is my dear father. He
      has succeeded with the steak.’
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole found himself confronted by a very young man, with deep
      black eyes, and a fresh, boyish expression. They began to talk.
    </p>
<p>
      Jules approached with the steak. Racksole tried to catch the waiter’s eye,
      but could not. The dinner proceeded.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, Father!’ cried Nella, ‘what a lot of mustard you have taken!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have I?’ he said, and then he happened to glance into a mirror on his
      left hand between two windows. He saw the reflection of Jules, who stood
      behind his chair, and he saw Jules give a slow, significant, ominous wink
      to Mr Dimmock—Christian name, Reginald.
    </p>
<p>
      He examined his mustard in silence. He thought that perhaps he had helped
      himself rather plenteously to mustard.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Three AT THREE A.M.
    </h2>
<p>
      MR REGINALD DIMMOCK proved himself, despite his extreme youth, to be a man
      of the world and of experiences, and a practised talker. Conversation
      between him and Nella Racksole seemed never to flag. They chattered about
      St Petersburg, and the ice on the Neva, and the tenor at the opera who had
      been exiled to Siberia, and the quality of Russian tea, and the sweetness
      of Russian champagne, and various other aspects of Muscovite existence.
      Russia exhausted, Nella lightly outlined her own doings since she had met
      the young man in the Tsar’s capital, and this recital brought the topic
      round to London, where it stayed till the final piece of steak was eaten.
      Theodore Racksole noticed that Mr Dimmock gave very meagre information
      about his own movements, either past or future. He regarded the youth as a
      typical hanger-on of Courts, and wondered how he had obtained his post of
      companion to Prince Aribert of Posen, and who Prince Aribert of Posen
      might be. The millionaire thought he had once heard of Posen, but he
      wasn’t sure; he rather fancied it was one of those small nondescript
      German States of which five-sixths of the subjects are Palace officials,
      and the rest charcoal-burners or innkeepers. Until the meal was nearly
      over, Racksole said little—perhaps his thoughts were too busy with
      Jules’ wink to Mr Dimmock, but when ices had been followed by coffee, he
      decided that it might be as well, in the interests of the hotel, to
      discover something about his daughter’s friend. He never for an instant
      questioned her right to possess her own friends; he had always left her in
      the most amazing liberty, relying on her inherited good sense to keep her
      out of mischief; but, quite apart from the wink, he was struck by Nella’s
      attitude towards Mr Dimmock, an attitude in which an amiable scorn was
      blended with an evident desire to propitiate and please.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nella tells me, Mr Dimmock, that you hold a confidential position with
      Prince Aribert of Posen,’ said Racksole. ‘You will pardon an American’s
      ignorance, but is Prince Aribert a reigning Prince—what, I believe,
      you call in Europe, a Prince Regnant?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘His Highness is not a reigning Prince, nor ever likely to be,’ answered
      Dimmock. ‘The Grand Ducal Throne of Posen is occupied by his Highness’s
      nephew, the Grand Duke Eugen.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nephew?’ cried Nella with astonishment.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not, dear lady?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But Prince Aribert is surely very young?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Prince, by one of those vagaries of chance which occur sometimes in
      the history of families, is precisely the same age as the Grand Duke. The
      late Grand Duke’s father was twice married. Hence this youthfulness on the
      part of an uncle.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How delicious to be the uncle of someone as old as yourself! But I
      suppose it is no fun for Prince Aribert. I suppose he has to be
      frightfully respectful and obedient, and all that, to his nephew?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Grand Duke and my Serene master are like brothers. At present, of
      course, Prince Aribert is nominally heir to the throne, but as no doubt
      you are aware, the Grand Duke will shortly marry a near relative of the
      Emperor’s, and should there be a family—’ Mr Dimmock stopped and
      shrugged his straight shoulders. ‘The Grand Duke,’ he went on, without
      finishing the last sentence, ‘would much prefer Prince Aribert to be his
      successor. He really doesn’t want to marry. Between ourselves, strictly
      between ourselves, he regards marriage as rather a bore. But, of course,
      being a German Grand Duke, he is bound to marry. He owes it to his
      country, to Posen.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How large is Posen?’ asked Racksole bluntly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father,’ Nella interposed laughing, ‘you shouldn’t ask such inconvenient
      questions. You ought to have guessed that it isn’t etiquette to inquire
      about the size of a German Dukedom.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am sure,’ said Dimmock, with a polite smile, ‘that the Grand Duke is as
      much amused as anyone at the size of his territory. I forget the exact
      acreage, but I remember that once Prince Aribert and myself walked across
      it and back again in a single day.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then the Grand Duke cannot travel very far within his own dominions? You
      may say that the sun does set on his empire?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It does,’ said Dimmock.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Unless the weather is cloudy,’ Nella put in. ‘Is the Grand Duke content
      always to stay at home?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On the contrary, he is a great traveller, much more so than Prince
      Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      I may tell you, what no one knows at present, outside this hotel, that his
      Royal Highness the Grand Duke, with a small suite, will be here
      to-morrow.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In London?’ asked Nella.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In this hotel?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! How lovely!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is why your humble servant is here to-night—a sort of advance
      guard.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But I understood,’ Racksole said, ‘that you were—er—attached
      to Prince Aribert, the uncle.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am. Prince Aribert will also be here. The Grand Duke and the Prince
      have business about important investments connected with the Grand Duke’s
      marriage settlement.... In the highest quarters, you understand.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For so discreet a person,’ thought Racksole, ‘you are fairly
      communicative.’ Then he said aloud: ‘Shall we go out on the terrace?’
    </p>
<p>
      As they crossed the dining-room Jules stopped Mr Dimmock and handed him a
      letter. ‘Just come, sir, by messenger,’ said Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella dropped behind for a second with her father. ‘Leave me alone with
      this boy a little—there’s a dear parent,’ she whispered in his ear.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am a mere cypher, an obedient nobody,’ Racksole replied, pinching her
      arm surreptitiously. ‘Treat me as such. Use me as you like. I will go and
      look after my hotel’ And soon afterwards he disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella and Mr Dimmock sat together on the terrace, sipping iced drinks.
      They made a handsome couple, bowered amid plants which blossomed at the
      command of a Chelsea wholesale florist. People who passed by remarked
      privately that from the look of things there was the beginning of a
      romance in that conversation. Perhaps there was, but a more intimate
      acquaintance with the character of Nella Racksole would have been
      necessary in order to predict what precise form that romance would take.
    </p>
<p>
      Jules himself served the liquids, and at ten o’clock he brought another
      note. Entreating a thousand pardons, Reginald Dimmock, after he had
      glanced at the note, excused himself on the plea of urgent business for
      his Serene master, uncle of the Grand Duke of Posen. He asked if he might
      fetch Mr Racksole, or escort Miss Racksole to her father. But Miss
      Racksole said gaily that she felt no need of an escort, and should go to
      bed. She added that her father and herself always endeavoured to be
      independent of each other.
    </p>
<p>
      Just then Theodore Racksole had found his way once more into Mr Babylon’s
      private room. Before arriving there, however, he had discovered that in
      some mysterious manner the news of the change of proprietorship had worked
      its way down to the lowest strata of the hotel’s cosmos. The corridors
      hummed with it, and even under-servants were to be seen discussing the
      thing, just as though it mattered to them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have a cigar, Mr Racksole,’ said the urbane Mr Babylon, ‘and a mouthful
      of the oldest cognac in all Europe.’
    </p>
<p>
      In a few minutes these two were talking eagerly, rapidly. Felix Babylon
      was astonished at Racksole’s capacity for absorbing the details of hotel
      management. And as for Racksole he soon realized that Felix Babylon must
      be a prince of hotel managers. It had never occurred to Racksole before
      that to manage an hotel, even a large hotel, could be a specially
      interesting affair, or that it could make any excessive demands upon the
      brains of the manager; but he came to see that he had underrated the
      possibilities of an hotel. The business of the Grand Babylon was enormous.
      It took Racksole, with all his genius for organization, exactly half an
      hour to master the details of the hotel laundry-work. And the laundry-work
      was but one branch of activity amid scores, and not a very large one at
      that. The machinery of checking supplies, and of establishing a mean ratio
      between the raw stuff received in the kitchen and the number of meals
      served in the salle Ã  manger and the private rooms, was very complicated
      and delicate. When Racksole had grasped it, he at once suggested some
      improvements, and this led to a long theoretical discussion, and the
      discussion led to digressions, and then Felix Babylon, in a moment of
      absent-mindedness, yawned.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole looked at the gilt clock on the high mantelpiece.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Great Scott!’ he said. ‘It’s three o’clock. Mr Babylon, accept my
      apologies for having kept you up to such an absurd hour.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have not spent so pleasant an evening for many years. You have let me
      ride my hobby to my heart’s content. It is I who should apologize.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole rose.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I should like to ask you one question,’ said Babylon. ‘Have you ever had
      anything to do with hotels before?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you have missed your vocation. You could have been the greatest of
      all hotel-managers. You would have been greater than me, and I am
      unequalled, though I keep only one hotel, and some men have half a dozen.
      Mr Racksole, why have you never run an hotel?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Heaven knows,’ he laughed, ‘but you flatter me, Mr Babylon.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I? Flatter? You do not know me. I flatter no one, except, perhaps, now
      and then an exceptionally distinguished guest. In which case I give
      suitable instructions as to the bill.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Speaking of distinguished guests, I am told that a couple of German
      princes are coming here to-morrow.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is so.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Does one do anything? Does one receive them formally—stand bowing
      in the entrance-hall, or anything of that sort?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not necessarily. Not unless one wishes. The modern hotel proprietor is
      not like an innkeeper of the Middle Ages, and even princes do not expect
      to see him unless something should happen to go wrong. As a matter of
      fact, though the Grand Duke of Posen and Prince Aribert have both honoured
      me by staying here before, I have never even set eyes on them. You will
      find all arrangements have been made.’
    </p>
<p>
      They talked a little longer, and then Racksole said good night. ‘Let me
      see you to your room. The lifts will be closed and the place will be
      deserted.
    </p>
<p>
      As for myself, I sleep here,’ and Mr Babylon pointed to an inner door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, thanks,’ said Racksole; ‘let me explore my own hotel unaccompanied. I
      believe I can discover my room.’ When he got fairly into the passages,
      Racksole was not so sure that he could discover his own room. The number
      was 107, but he had forgotten whether it was on the first or second floor.
    </p>
<p>
      Travelling in a lift, one is unconscious of floors. He passed several
      lift-doorways, but he could see no glint of a staircase; in all
      self-respecting hotels staircases have gone out of fashion, and though
      hotel architects still continue, for old sakes’ sake, to build staircases,
      they are tucked away in remote corners where their presence is not likely
      to offend the eye of a spoiled and cosmopolitan public. The hotel seemed
      vast, uncanny, deserted. An electric light glowed here and there at long
      intervals. On the thick carpets, Racksole’s thinly-shod feet made no
      sound, and he wandered at ease to and fro, rather amused, rather struck by
      the peculiar senses of night and mystery which had suddenly come over him.
      He fancied he could hear a thousand snores peacefully descending from the
      upper realms. At length he found a staircase, a very dark and narrow one,
      and presently he was on the first floor. He soon discovered that the
      numbers of the rooms on this floor did not get beyond seventy. He
      encountered another staircase and ascended to the second floor. By the
      decoration of the walls he recognized this floor as his proper home, and
      as he strolled through the long corridor he whistled a low, meditative
      whistle of satisfaction. He thought he heard a step in the transverse
      corridor, and instinctively he obliterated himself in a recess which held
      a service-cabinet and a chair. He did hear a step. Peeping cautiously out,
      he perceived, what he had not perceived previously, that a piece of white
      ribbon had been tied round the handle of the door of one of the bedrooms.
      Then a man came round the corner of the transverse corridor, and Racksole
      drew back. It was Jules—Jules with his hands in his pockets and a
      slouch hat over his eyes, but in other respects attired as usual.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole, at that instant, remembered with a special vividness what Felix
      Babylon had said to him at their first interview. He wished he had brought
      his revolver. He didn’t know why he should feel the desirability of a
      revolver in a London hotel of the most unimpeachable fair fame, but he did
      feel the desirability of such an instrument of attack and defence. He
      privately decided that if Jules went past his recess he would take him by
      the throat and in that attitude put a few plain questions to this highly
      dubious waiter. But Jules had stopped. The millionaire made another
      cautious observation. Jules, with infinite gentleness, was turning the
      handle of the door to which the white ribbon was attached. The door slowly
      yielded and Jules disappeared within the room. After a brief interval, the
      night-prowling Jules reappeared, closed the door as softly as he had
      opened it, removed the ribbon, returned upon his steps, and vanished down
      the transverse corridor.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is quaint,’ said Racksole; ‘quaint to a degree!’
    </p>
<p>
      It occurred to him to look at the number of the room, and he stole towards
      it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, I’m d—d!’ he murmured wonderingly.
    </p>
<p>
      The number was 111, his daughter’s room! He tried to open it, but the door
      was locked. Rushing to his own room, No. 107, he seized one of a pair of
      revolvers (the kind that are made for millionaires) and followed after
      Jules down the transverse corridor. At the end of this corridor was a
      window; the window was open; and Jules was innocently gazing out of the
      window. Ten silent strides, and Theodore Racksole was upon him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One word, my friend,’ the millionaire began, carelessly waving the
      revolver in the air. Jules was indubitably startled, but by an admirable
      exercise of self-control he recovered possession of his faculties in a
      second.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sir?’ said Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I just want to be informed, what the deuce you were doing in No. 111 a
      moment ago.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had been requested to go there,’ was the calm response.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are a liar, and not a very clever one. That is my daughter’s room.
      Now—out with it, before I decide whether to shoot you or throw you
      into the street.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Excuse me, sir, No. 111 is occupied by a gentleman.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I advise you that it is a serious error of judgement to contradict me, my
      friend. Don’t do it again. We will go to the room together, and you shall
      prove that the occupant is a gentleman, and not my daughter.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Impossible, sir,’ said Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Scarcely that,’ said Racksole, and he took Jules by the sleeve. The
      millionaire knew for a certainty that Nella occupied No. 111, for he had
      examined the room with her, and himself seen that her trunks and her maid and
      herself had arrived there in safety. ‘Now open the door,’ whispered
      Racksole, when they reached No.111.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must knock.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is just what you mustn’t do. Open it. No doubt you have your
      pass-key.’
    </p>
<p>
      Confronted by the revolver, Jules readily obeyed, yet with a deprecatory
      gesture, as though he would not be responsible for this outrage against
      the decorum of hotel life. Racksole entered. The room was brilliantly
      lighted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A visitor, who insists on seeing you, sir,’ said Jules, and fled.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr Reginald Dimmock, still in evening dress, and smoking a cigarette, rose
      hurriedly from a table.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hello, my dear Mr Racksole, this is an unexpected—ah—pleasure.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where is my daughter? This is her room.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did I catch what you said, Mr Racksole?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I venture to remark that this is Miss Racksole’s room.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My good sir,’ answered Dimmock, ‘you must be mad to dream of such a
      thing.
    </p>
<p>
      Only my respect for your daughter prevents me from expelling you forcibly,
      for such an extraordinary suggestion.’
    </p>
<p>
      A small spot half-way down the bridge of the millionaire’s nose turned
      suddenly white.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With your permission,’ he said in a low calm voice, ‘I will examine the
      dressing-room and the bath-room.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just listen to me a moment,’ Dimmock urged, in a milder tone.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ll listen to you afterwards, my young friend,’ said Racksole, and he
      proceeded to search the bath-room, and the dressing-room, without any
      result whatever. ‘Lest my attitude might be open to misconstruction, Mr
      Dimmock, I may as well tell you that I have the most perfect confidence in
      my daughter, who is as well able to take care of herself as any woman I
      ever met, but since you entered it there have been one or two rather
      mysterious occurrences in this hotel. That is all.’ Feeling a draught of
      air on his shoulder, Racksole turned to the window. ‘For instance,’ he
      added, ‘I perceive that this window is broken, badly broken, and from the
      outside.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, how could that have occurred?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you will kindly hear reason, Mr Racksole,’ said Dimmock in his best
      diplomatic manner, ‘I will endeavour to explain things to you. I regarded
      your first question to me when you entered my room as being offensively
      put, but I now see that you had some justification.’ He smiled politely.
      ‘I was passing along this corridor about eleven o’clock, when I found Miss
      Racksole in a difficulty with the hotel servants. Miss Racksole was
      retiring to rest in this room when a large stone, which must have been
      thrown from the Embankment, broke the window, as you see. Apart from the
      discomfort of the broken window, she did not care to remain in the room.
      She argued that where one stone had come another might follow. She
      therefore insisted on her room being changed. The servants said that there
      was no other room available with a dressing-room and bath-room attached,
      and your daughter made a point of these matters. I at once offered to
      exchange apartments with her. She did me the honour to accept my offer.
      Our respective belongings were moved—and that is all. Miss Racksole
      is at this moment, I trust, asleep in No. 124.’
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole looked at the young man for a few seconds in silence.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a faint knock at the door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come in,’ said Racksole loudly.
    </p>
<p>
      Someone pushed open the door, but remained standing on the mat. It was
      Nella’s maid, in a dressing-gown.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Racksole’s compliments, and a thousand excuses, but a book of hers
      was left on the mantelshelf in this room. She cannot sleep, and wishes to
      read.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Dimmock, I tender my apologies—my formal apologies,’ said
      Racksole, when the girl had gone away with the book. ‘Good night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pray don’t mention it,’ said Dimmock suavely—and bowed him out.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Four ENTRANCE OF THE PRINCE
    </h2>
<p>
      NEVERTHELESS, sundry small things weighed on Racksole’s mind. First there
      was Jules’ wink. Then there was the ribbon on the door-handle and Jules’
      visit to No. 111, and the broken window—broken from the outside.
      Racksole did not forget that the time was 3 a.m. He slept but little that
      night, but he was glad that he had bought the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel. It was
      an acquisition which seemed to promise fun and diversion.
    </p>
<p>
      The next morning he came across Mr Babylon early. ‘I have emptied my
      private room of all personal papers,’ said Babylon, ‘and it is now at your
      disposal.
    </p>
<p>
      I purpose, if agreeable to yourself, to stay on in the hotel as a guest
      for the present. We have much to settle with regard to the completion of
      the purchase, and also there are things which you might want to ask me.
      Also, to tell the truth, I am not anxious to leave the old place with too
      much suddenness. It will be a wrench to me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall be delighted if you will stay,’ said the millionaire, ‘but it
      must be as my guest, not as the guest of the hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are very kind.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As for wishing to consult you, no doubt I shall have need to do so, but I
      must say that the show seems to run itself.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said Babylon thoughtfully. ‘I have heard of hotels that run
      themselves. If they do, you may be sure that they obey the laws of gravity
      and run downwards. You will have your hands full. For example, have you
      yet heard about Miss Spencer?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ said Racksole. ‘What of her?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has mysteriously vanished during the night, and nobody appears to be
      able to throw any light on the affair. Her room is empty, her boxes gone.
    </p>
<p>
      You will want someone to take her place, and that someone will not be very
      easy to get.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘H’m!’ Racksole said, after a pause. ‘Hers is not the only post that falls
      vacant to-day.’
    </p>
<p>
      A little later, the millionaire installed himself in the late owner’s
      private room and rang the bell.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want Jules,’ he said to the page.
    </p>
<p>
      While waiting for Jules, Racksole considered the question of Miss
      Spencer’s disappearance.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good morning, Jules,’ was his cheerful greeting, when the imperturbable
      waiter arrived.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good morning, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Take a chair.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thank you, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We have met before this morning, Jules.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, sir, at 3 a.m.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rather strange about Miss Spencer’s departure, is it not?’ suggested
      Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is remarkable, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are aware, of course, that Mr Babylon has transferred all his
      interests in this hotel to me?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have been informed to that effect, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose you know everything that goes on in the hotel, Jules?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As the head waiter, sir, it is my business to keep a general eye on
      things.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You speak very good English for a foreigner, Jules.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For a foreigner, sir! I am an Englishman, a Hertfordshire man born and
      bred. Perhaps my name has misled you, sir. I am only called Jules because
      the head waiter of any really high-class hotel must have either a French
      or an Italian name.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I see,’ said Racksole. ‘I think you must be rather a clever person,
      Jules.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is not for me to say, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How long has the hotel enjoyed the advantage of your services?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A little over twenty years.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is a long time to be in one place. Don’t you think it’s time you got
      out of the rut? You are still young, and might make a reputation for
      yourself in another and wider sphere.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole looked at the man steadily, and his glance was steadily returned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You aren’t satisfied with me, sir?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To be frank, Jules, I think—I think you—er—wink too
      much. And I think that it is regrettable when a head waiter falls into a
      habit of taking white ribbons from the handles of bedroom doors at three
      in the morning.’
    </p>
<p>
      Jules started slightly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I see how it is, sir. You wish me to go, and one pretext, if I may use
      the term, is as good as another. Very well, I can’t say that I’m
      surprised. It sometimes happens that there is incompatibility of temper
      between a hotel proprietor and his head waiter, and then, unless one of
      them goes, the hotel is likely to suffer. I will go, Mr Racksole. In fact,
      I had already thought of giving notice.’
    </p>
<p>
      The millionaire smiled appreciatively. ‘What wages do you require in lieu
      of notice? It is my intention that you leave the hotel within an hour.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I require no wages in lieu of notice, sir. I would scorn to accept
      anything. And I will leave the hotel in fifteen minutes.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good-day, then. You have my good wishes and my admiration, so long as you
      keep out of my hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole got up. ‘Good-day, sir. And thank you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘By the way, Jules, it will be useless for you to apply to any other
      first-rate European hotel for a post, because I shall take measures which
      will ensure the rejection of any such application.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Without discussing the question whether or not there aren’t at least half
      a dozen hotels in London alone that would jump for joy at the chance of
      getting me,’ answered Jules, ‘I may tell you, sir, that I shall retire
      from my profession.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Really! You will turn your brains to a different channel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, sir. I shall take rooms in Albemarle Street or Jermyn Street, and
      just be content to be a man-about-town. I have saved some twenty thousand
      pounds—a mere trifle, but sufficient for my needs, and I shall now
      proceed to enjoy it. Pardon me for troubling you with my personal affairs.
      And good-day again.’
    </p>
<p>
      That afternoon Racksole went with Felix Babylon first to a firm of
      solicitors in the City, and then to a stockbroker, in order to carry out
      the practical details of the purchase of the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean to settle in England,’ said Racksole, as they were coming back.
      ‘It is the only country—’ and he stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The only country?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The only country where you can invest money and spend money with a
      feeling of security. In the United States there is nothing worth spending
      money on, nothing to buy. In France or Italy, there is no real security.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But surely you are a true American?’ questioned Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am a true American,’ said Racksole, ‘but my father, who began by being
      a bedmaker at an Oxford college, and ultimately made ten million dollars
      out of iron in Pittsburg—my father took the wise precaution of
      having me educated in England. I had my three years at Oxford, like any
      son of the upper middle class! It did me good. It has been worth more to
      me than many successful speculations. It taught me that the English
      language is different from, and better than, the American language, and
      that there is something—I haven’t yet found out exactly what—in
      English life that Americans will never get. Why,’ he added, ‘in the United
      States we still bribe our judges and our newspapers. And we talk of the
      eighteenth century as though it was the beginning of the world. Yes, I
      shall transfer my securities to London. I shall build a house in Park
      Lane, and I shall buy some immemorial country seat with a history as long
      as the A. T. and S. railroad, and I shall calmly and gradually settle
      down. D’you know—I am rather a good-natured man for a millionaire,
      and of a social disposition, and yet I haven’t six real friends in the
      whole of New York City. Think of that!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And I,’ said Babylon, ‘have no friends except the friends of my boyhood
      in Lausanne. I have spent thirty years in England, and gained nothing but
      a perfect knowledge of the English language and as much gold coin as would
      fill a rather large box.’
    </p>
<p>
      These two plutocrats breathed a simultaneous sigh.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Talking of gold coin,’ said Racksole, ‘how much money should you think
      Jules has contrived to amass while he has been with you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh!’ Babylon smiled. ‘I should not like to guess. He has had unique
      opportunities—opportunities.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Should you consider twenty thousand an extraordinary sum under the
      circumstances?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all. Has he been confiding in you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Somewhat. I have dismissed him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have dismissed him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is no reason why not. But I have felt inclined to dismiss him for
      the past ten years, and never found courage to do it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It was a perfectly simple proceeding, I assure you. Before I had done
      with him, I rather liked the fellow.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Spencer and Jules—both gone in one day!’ mused Felix Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And no one to take their places,’ said Racksole. ‘And yet the hotel
      continues its way!’
    </p>
<p>
      But when Racksole reached the Grand Babylon he found that Miss Spencer’s
      chair in the bureau was occupied by a stately and imperious girl, dressed
      becomingly in black.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Heavens, Nella!’ he cried, going to the bureau. ‘What are you doing
      here?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am taking Mis Spencer’s place. I want to help you with your hotel, Dad.
      I fancy I shall make an excellent hotel clerk. I have arranged with a Miss
      Selina Smith, one of the typists in the office, to put me up to all the
      tips and tricks, and I shall do very well.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But look here, Helen Racksole. We shall have the whole of London talking
      about this thing—the greatest of all American heiresses a hotel
      clerk! And I came here for quiet and rest!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose it was for the sake of quiet and rest that you bought the
      hotel, Papa?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You would insist on the steak,’ he retorted. ‘Get out of this, on the
      instant.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Here I am, here to stay,’ said Nella, and deliberately laughed at her
      parent.
    </p>
<p>
      Just then the face of a fair-haired man of about thirty years appeared at
      the bureau window. He was very well-dressed, very aristocratic in his
      pose, and he seemed rather angry.
    </p>
<p>
      He looked fixedly at Nella and started back.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ach!’ he exclaimed. ‘You!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, your Highness, it is indeed I. Father, this is his Serene Highness
      Prince Aribert of Posen—one of our most esteemed customers.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You know my name, Fräulein?’ the new-comer murmured in German.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly, Prince,’ Nella replied sweetly. ‘You were plain Count
      Steenbock last spring in Paris—doubtless travelling incognito—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Silence,’ he entreated, with a wave of the hand, and his forehead went as
      white as paper.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Five WHAT OCCURRED TO REGINALD DIMMOCK
    </h2>
<p>
      IN another moment they were all three talking quite nicely, and with at
      any rate an appearance of being natural. Prince Aribert became suave, even
      deferential to Nella, and more friendly towards Nella’s father than their
      respective positions demanded. The latter amused himself by studying this
      sprig of royalty, the first with whom he had ever come into contact. He
      decided that the young fellow was personable enough, ‘had no frills on
      him,’ and would make an exceptionally good commercial traveller for a
      first-class firm. Such was Theodore Racksole’s preliminary estimate of the
      man who might one day be the reigning Grand Duke of Posen.
    </p>
<p>
      It occurred to Nella, and she smiled at the idea, that the bureau of the
      hotel was scarcely the correct place in which to receive this august young
      man. There he stood, with his head half-way through the bureau window,
      negligently leaning against the woodwork, just as though he were a
      stockbroker or the manager of a New York burlesque company.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is your Highness travelling quite alone?’ she asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘By a series of accidents I am,’ he said. ‘My equerry was to have met me
      at Charing Cross, but he failed to do so—I cannot imagine why.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Dimmock?’ questioned Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, Dimmock. I do not remember that he ever missed an appointment
      before.
    </p>
<p>
      You know him? He has been here?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He dined with us last night,’ said Racksole—‘on Nella’s
      invitation,’ he added maliciously; ‘but to-day we have seen nothing of
      him. I know, however, that he has engaged the State apartments, and also a
      suite adjoining the State apartments—No. 55. That is so, isn’t it,
      Nella?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, Papa,’ she said, having first demurely examined a ledger. ‘Your
      Highness would doubtless like to be conducted to your room—apartments
      I mean.’ Then Nella laughed deliberately at the Prince, and said, ‘I don’t
      know who is the proper person to conduct you, and that’s a fact. The truth
      is that Papa and I are rather raw yet in the hotel line. You see, we only
      bought the place last night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have bought the hotel!’ exclaimed the Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s so,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And Felix Babylon has gone?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He is going, if he has not already gone.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! I see,’ said the Prince; ‘this is one of your American “strokes”. You
      have bought to sell again, is that not it? You are on your holidays, but
      you cannot resist making a few thousands by way of relaxation. I have
      heard of such things.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We sha’n’t sell again, Prince, until we are tired of our bargain.
      Sometimes we tire very quickly, and sometimes we don’t. It depends—eh?
      What?’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole broke off suddenly to attend to a servant in livery who had
      quietly entered the bureau and was making urgent mysterious signs to him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you please, sir,’ the man by frantic gestures implored Mr Theodore
      Racksole to come out.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pray don’t let me detain you, Mr Racksole,’ said the Prince, and
      therefore the proprietor of the Grand Babylon departed after the servant,
      with a queer, curt little bow to Prince Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mayn’t I come inside?’ said the Prince to Nella immediately the
      millionaire had gone.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Impossible, Prince,’ Nella laughed. ‘The rule against visitors entering
      this bureau is frightfully strict.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How do you know the rule is so strict if you only came into possession
      last night?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I know because I made the rule myself this morning, your Highness.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But seriously, Miss Racksole, I want to talk to you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you want to talk to me as Prince Aribert or as the friend—the
      acquaintance—whom I knew in Paris last year?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As the friend, dear lady, if I may use the term.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you are sure that you would not like first to be conducted to your
      apartments?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not yet. I will wait till Dimmock comes; he cannot fail to be here soon.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then we will have tea served in father’s private room—the
      proprietor’s private room, you know.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good!’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella talked through a telephone, and rang several bells, and behaved
      generally in a manner calculated to prove to Princes and to whomever it
      might concern that she was a young woman of business instincts and
      training, and then she stepped down from her chair of office, emerged from
      the bureau, and, preceded by two menials, led Prince Aribert to the Louis
      XV chamber in which her father and Felix Babylon had had their long
      confabulation on the previous evening.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you want to talk to me about?’ she asked her companion, as she
      poured out for him a second cup of tea. The Prince looked at her for a
      moment as he took the proffered cup, and being a young man of sane,
      healthy, instincts, he could think of nothing for the moment except her
      loveliness.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella was indeed beautiful that afternoon. The beauty of even the most
      beautiful woman ebbs and flows from hour to hour. Nella’s this afternoon
      was at the flood. Vivacious, alert, imperious, and yet ineffably sweet,
      she seemed to radiate the very joy and exuberance of life.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have forgotten,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have forgotten! That is surely very wrong of you? You gave me to
      understand that it was something terribly important. But of course I knew
      it couldn’t be, because no man, and especially no Prince, ever discussed
      anything really important with a woman.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Recollect, Miss Racksole, that this afternoon, here, I am not the
      Prince.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are Count Steenbock, is that it?’
    </p>
<p>
      He started. ‘For you only,’ he said, unconsciously lowering his voice.
      ‘Miss Racksole, I particularly wish that no one here should know that I
      was in Paris last spring.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘An affair of State?’ she smiled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘An affair of State,’ he replied soberly. ‘Even Dimmock doesn’t know. It
      was strange that we should be fellow guests at that quiet out-of-the-way
      hotel—strange but delightful. I shall never forget that rainy
      afternoon that we spent together in the Museum of the Trocadéro. Let us
      talk about that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘About the rain, or the museum?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall never forget that afternoon,’ he repeated, ignoring the lightness
      of her question.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nor I,’ she murmured corresponding to his mood.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You, too enjoyed it?’ he said eagerly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The sculptures were magnificent,’ she replied, hastily glancing at the
      ceiling.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! So they were! Tell me, Miss Racksole, how did you discover my
      identity.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must not say,’ she answered. ‘That is my secret. Do not seek to
      penetrate it. Who knows what horrors you might discover if you probed too
      far?’ She laughed, but she laughed alone. The Prince remained pensive—as
      it were brooding.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I never hoped to see you again,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One never sees again those whom one wishes to see.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As for me, I was perfectly convinced that we should meet again.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because I always get what I want.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you wanted to see me again?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly. You interested me extremely. I have never met another man who
      could talk so well about sculpture as the Count Steenbock.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you really always get what you want, Miss Racksole?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of course.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is because your father is so rich, I suppose?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, no, it isn’t!’ she said. ‘It’s simply because I always do get what I
      want. It’s got nothing to do with Father at all.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But Mr Racksole is extremely wealthy?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Wealthy isn’t the word, Count. There is no word. It’s positively awful
      the amount of dollars poor Papa makes. And the worst of it is he can’t
      help it.
    </p>
<p>
      He told me once that when a man had made ten millions no power on earth
      could stop those ten millions from growing into twenty. And so it
      continues.
    </p>
<p>
      I spend what I can, but I can’t come near coping with it; and of course
      Papa is no use whatever at spending.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you have no mother?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who told you I had no mother?’ she asked quietly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I—er—inquired about you,’ he said, with equal candour and
      humility.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In spite of the fact that you never hoped to see me again?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, in spite of that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How funny!’ she said, and lapsed into a meditative silence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yours must be a wonderful existence,’ said the Prince. ‘I envy you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You envy me—what? My father’s wealth?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ he said; ‘your freedom and your responsibilities.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have no responsibilities,’ she remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pardon me,’ he said; ‘you have, and the time is coming when you will feel
      them.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m only a girl,’ she murmured with sudden simplicity. ‘As for you,
      Count, surely you have sufficient responsibilities of your own?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I?’ he said sadly. ‘I have no responsibilities. I am a nobody—a
      Serene Highness who has to pretend to be very important, always taking
      immense care never to do anything that a Serene Highness ought not to do.
      Bah!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But if your nephew, Prince Eugen, were to die, would you not come to the
      throne, and would you not then have these responsibilities which you so
      much desire?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Eugen die?’ said Prince Aribert, in a curious tone. ‘Impossible. He is
      the perfection of health. In three months he will be married. No, I shall
      never be anything but a Serene Highness, the most despicable of God’s
      creatures.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what about the State secret which you mentioned? Is not that a
      responsibility?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ he said. ‘That is over. That belongs to the past. It was an accident
      in my dull career. I shall never be Count Steenbock again.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who knows?’ she said. ‘By the way, is not Prince Eugen coming here
      to-day? Mr Dimmock told us so.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘See!’ answered the Prince, standing up and bending over her. ‘I am going
      to confide in you. I don’t know why, but I am.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t betray State secrets,’ she warned him, smiling into his face.
    </p>
<p>
      But just then the door of the room was unceremoniously opened.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Go right in,’ said a voice sharply. It was Theodore Racksole’s. Two men
      entered, bearing a prone form on a stretcher, and Racksole followed them.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella sprang up. Racksole stared to see his daughter.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I didn’t know you were in here, Nell. Here,’ to the two men, ‘out again.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why!’ exclaimed Nella, gazing fearfully at the form on the stretcher,
      ‘it’s Mr Dimmock!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is,’ her father acquiesced. ‘He’s dead,’ he added laconically. ‘I’d
      have broken it to you more gently had I known. Your pardon, Prince.’ There
      was a pause.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dimmock dead!’ Prince Aribert whispered under his breath, and he kneeled
      down by the side of the stretcher. ‘What does this mean?’
    </p>
<p>
      The poor fellow was just walking across the quadrangle towards the portico
      when he fell down. A commissionaire who saw him says he was walking very
      quickly. At first I thought it was sunstroke, but it couldn’t have been,
      though the weather certainly is rather warm. It must be heart disease. But
      anyhow, he’s dead. We did what we could. I’ve sent for a doctor, and for
      the police. I suppose there’ll have to be an inquest.’
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole stopped, and in an awkward solemn silence they all gazed
      at the dead youth. His features were slightly drawn, and his eyes closed;
      that was all. He might have been asleep.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My poor Dimmock!’ exclaimed the Prince, his voice broken. ‘And I was
      angry because the lad did not meet me at Charing Cross!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Are you sure he is dead, Father?’ Nella said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’d better go away, Nella,’ was Racksole’s only reply; but the girl
      stood still, and began to sob quietly. On the previous night she had
      secretly made fun of Reginald Dimmock. She had deliberately set herself to
      get information from him on a topic in which she happened to be specially
      interested and she had got it, laughing the while at his youthful
      crudities—his vanity, his transparent cunning, his absurd airs. She
      had not liked him; she had even distrusted him, and decided that he was
      not ‘nice’. But now, as he lay on the stretcher, these things were
      forgotten. She went so far as to reproach herself for them. Such is the
      strange commanding power of death.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oblige me by taking the poor fellow to my apartments,’ said the Prince,
      with a gesture to the attendants. ‘Surely it is time the doctor came.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole felt suddenly at that moment he was nothing but a mere hotel
      proprietor with an awkward affair on his hands. For a fraction of a second
      he wished he had never bought the Grand Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      A quarter of an hour later Prince Aribert, Theodore Racksole, a doctor,
      and an inspector of police were in the Prince’s reception-room. They had
      just come from an ante-chamber, in which lay the mortal remains of
      Reginald Dimmock.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well?’ said Racksole, glancing at the doctor.
    </p>
<p>
      The doctor was a big, boyish-looking man, with keen, quizzical eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is not heart disease,’ said the doctor.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not heart disease?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then what is it?’ asked the Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I may be able to answer that question after the post-mortem,’ said the
      doctor. ‘I certainly can’t answer it now. The symptoms are unusual to a
      degree.’
    </p>
<p>
      The inspector of police began to write in a note-book.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Six IN THE GOLD ROOM
    </h2>
<p>
      AT the Grand Babylon a great ball was given that night in the Gold Room, a
      huge saloon attached to the hotel, though scarcely part of it, and
      certainly less exclusive than the hotel itself. Theodore Racksole knew
      nothing of the affair, except that it was an entertainment offered by a Mr
      and Mrs Sampson Levi to their friends. Who Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi were he
      did not know, nor could anyone tell him anything about them except that Mr
      Sampson Levi was a prominent member of that part of the Stock Exchange
      familiarly called the Kaffir Circus, and that his wife was a stout lady
      with an aquiline nose and many diamonds, and that they were very rich and
      very hospitable. Theodore Racksole did not want a ball in his hotel that
      evening, and just before dinner he had almost a mind to issue a decree
      that the Gold Room was to be closed and the ball forbidden, and Mr and Mrs
      Sampson Levi might name the amount of damages suffered by them. His
      reasons for such a course were threefold—first, he felt depressed
      and uneasy; second, he didn’t like the name of Sampson Levi; and, third,
      he had a desire to show these so-called plutocrats that their wealth was
      nothing to him, that they could not do what they chose with Theodore
      Racksole, and that for two pins Theodore Racksole would buy them up, and
      the whole Kaffir Circus to boot. But something warned him that though such
      a high-handed proceeding might be tolerated in America, that land of
      freedom, it would never be tolerated in England. He felt instinctively
      that in England there are things you can’t do, and that this particular
      thing was one of them. So the ball went forward, and neither Mr nor Mrs
      Sampson Levi had ever the least suspicion what a narrow escape they had
      had of looking very foolish in the eyes of the thousand or so guests
      invited by them to the Gold Room of the Grand Babylon that evening.
    </p>
<p>
      The Gold Room of the Grand Babylon was built for a ballroom. A balcony,
      supported by arches faced with gilt and lapis-lazulo, ran around it, and
      from this vantage men and maidens and chaperons who could not or would not
      dance might survey the scene. Everyone knew this, and most people took
      advantage of it. What everyone did not know—what no one knew—was
      that higher up than the balcony there was a little barred window in the
      end wall from which the hotel authorities might keep a watchful eye, not
      only on the dancers, but on the occupants of the balcony itself.
    </p>
<p>
      It may seem incredible to the uninitiated that the guests at any social
      gathering held in so gorgeous and renowned an apartment as the Gold Room
      of the Grand Babylon should need the observation of a watchful eye. Yet so
      it was. Strange matters and unexpected faces had been descried from the
      little window, and more than one European detective had kept vigil there
      with the most eminently satisfactory results.
    </p>
<p>
      At eleven o’clock Theodore Racksole, afflicted by vexation of spirit,
      found himself gazing idly through the little barred window. Nella was with
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      Together they had been wandering about the corridors of the hotel, still
      strange to them both, and it was quite by accident that they had lighted
      upon the small room which had a surreptitious view of Mr and Mrs Sampson
      Levi’s ball. Except for the light of the chandelier of the ball-room the
      little cubicle was in darkness. Nella was looking through the window; her
      father stood behind.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I wonder which is Mrs Sampson Levi?’ Nella said, ‘and whether she matches
      her name. Wouldn’t you love to have a name like that, Father—something
      that people could take hold of—instead of Racksole?’
    </p>
<p>
      The sound of violins and a confused murmur of voices rose gently up to
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Umphl’ said Theodore. ‘Curse those evening papers!’ he added,
      inconsequently but with sincerity.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father, you’re very horrid to-night. What have the evening papers been
      doing?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, my young madame, they’ve got me in for one, and you for another;
      and they’re manufacturing mysteries like fun. It’s young Dimmock’s death
      that has started ‘em.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, Father, you surely didn’t expect to keep yourself out of the
      papers. Besides, as regards newspapers, you ought to be glad you aren’t in
      New York. Just fancy what the dear old Herald would have made out of a
      little transaction like yours of last night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s true,’ assented Racksole. ‘But it’ll be all over New York
      to-morrow morning, all the same. The worst of it is that Babylon has gone
      off to Switzerland.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t know. Sudden fancy, I guess, for his native heath.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What difference does it make to you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘None. Only I feel sort of lonesome. I feel I want someone to lean up
      against in running this hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Father, if you have that feeling you must be getting ill.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ he sighed, ‘I admit it’s unusual with me. But perhaps you haven’t
      grasped the fact, Nella, that we’re in the middle of a rather queer
      business.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You mean about poor Mr Dimmock?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Partly Dimmock and partly other things. First of all, that Miss Spencer,
      or whatever her wretched name is, mysteriously disappears. Then there was
      the stone thrown into your bedroom. Then I caught that rascal Jules
      conspiring with Dimmock at three o’clock in the morning. Then your
      precious Prince Aribert arrives without any suite—which I believe is
      a most peculiar and wicked thing for a Prince to do—and moreover I
      find my daughter on very intimate terms with the said Prince. Then young
      Dimmock goes and dies, and there is to be an inquest; then Prince Eugen
      and his suite, who were expected here for dinner, fail to turn up at all—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Prince Eugen has not come?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He has not; and Uncle Aribert is in a deuce of a stew about him, and
      telegraphing all over Europe. Altogether, things are working up pretty
      lively.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you really think, Dad, there was anything between Jules and poor Mr
      Dimmock?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Think! I know! I tell you I saw that scamp give Dimmock a wink last night
      at dinner that might have meant—well!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So you caught that wink, did you, Dad?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why, did you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of course, Dad. I was going to tell you about it.’
    </p>
<p>
      The millionaire grunted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Look here, Father,’ Nella whispered suddenly, and pointed to the balcony
      immediately below them. ‘Who’s that?’ She indicated a man with a bald
      patch on the back of his head, who was propping himself up against the
      railing of the balcony and gazing immovable into the ball-room.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, who is it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Isn’t it Jules?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gemini! By the beard of the prophet, it is!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps Mr Jules is a guest of Mrs Sampson Levi.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Guest or no guest, he goes out of this hotel, even if I have to throw him
      out myself.’
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole disappeared without another word, and Nella followed
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      But when the millionaire arrived on the balcony floor he could see nothing
      of Jules, neither there nor in the ball-room itself. Saying no word aloud,
      but quietly whispering wicked expletives, he searched everywhere in vain,
      and then, at last, by tortuous stairways and corridors returned to his
      original post of observation, that he might survey the place anew from the
      vantage ground. To his surprise he found a man in the dark little room,
      watching the scene of the ball as intently as he himself had been doing a
      few minutes before. Hearing footsteps, the man turned with a start.
    </p>
<p>
      It was Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      The two exchanged glances in the half light for a second.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good evening, Mr Racksole,’ said Jules calmly. ‘I must apologize for
      being here.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Force of habit, I suppose,’ said Theodore Racksole drily.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just so, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I fancied I had forbidden you to re-enter this hotel?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I thought your order applied only to my professional capacity. I am here
      to-night as the guest of Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In your new rÃ´le of man-about-town, eh?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Exactly.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But I don’t allow men-about-town up here, my friend.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For being up here I have already apologized.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, having apologized, you had better depart; that is my disinterested
      advice to you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good night, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And, I say, Mr Jules, if Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi, or any other Hebrews or
      Christians, should again invite you to my hotel you will oblige me by
      declining the invitation. You’ll find that will be the safest course for
      you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good night, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      Before midnight struck Theodore Racksole had ascertained that the
      invitation-list of Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi, though a somewhat lengthy one,
      contained no reference to any such person as Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      He sat up very late. To be precise, he sat up all night. He was a man who,
      by dint of training, could comfortably dispense with sleep when he felt so
      inclined, or when circumstances made such a course advisable. He walked to
      and fro in his room, and cogitated as few people beside Theodore Racksole
      could cogitate. At 6 a.m. he took a stroll round the business part of his
      premises, and watched the supplies come in from Covent Garden, from
      Smithfield, from Billingsgate, and from other strange places. He found the
      proceedings of the kitchen department quite interesting, and made mental
      notes of things that he would have altered, of men whose wages he would
      increase and men whose wages he would reduce. At 7 a.m. he happened to be
      standing near the luggage lift, and witnessed the descent of vast
      quantities of luggage, and its disappearance into a Carter Paterson van.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Whose luggage is that?’ he inquired peremptorily.
    </p>
<p>
      The luggage clerk, with an aggrieved expression, explained to him that it
      was the luggage of nobody in particular, that it belonged to various
      guests, and was bound for various destinations; that it was, in fact,
      ‘expressed’ luggage despatched in advance, and that a similar quantity of
      it left the hotel every morning about that hour.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole walked away, and breakfasted upon one cup of tea and
      half a slice of toast.
    </p>
<p>
      At ten o’clock he was informed that the inspector of police desired to see
      him. The inspector had come, he said, to superintend the removal of the
      body of Reginald Dimmock to the mortuary adjoining the place of inquest,
      and a suitable vehicle waited at the back entrance of the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
      The inspector had also brought subpoenas for himself and Prince Aribert of
      Posen and the commissionaire to attend the inquest.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I thought Mr Dimmock’s remains were removed last night,’ said Racksole
      wearily.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, sir. The fact is the van was engaged on another job.’
    </p>
<p>
      The inspector gave the least hint of a professional smile, and Racksole,
      disgusted, told him curtly to go and perform his duties.
    </p>
<p>
      In a few minutes a message came from the inspector requesting Mr Racksole
      to be good enough to come to him on the first floor. Racksole went. In the
      ante-room, where the body of Reginald Dimmock had originally been placed,
      were the inspector and Prince Aribert, and two policemen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well?’ said Racksole, after he and the Prince had exchanged bows. Then he
      saw a coffin laid across two chairs. ‘I see a coffin has been obtained,’
      he remarked. ‘Quite right’ He approached it. ‘It’s empty,’ he observed
      unthinkingly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just so,’ said the inspector. ‘The body of the deceased has disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      And his Serene Highness Prince Aribert informs me that though he has
      occupied a room immediately opposite, on the other side of the corridor,
      he can throw no light on the affair.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Indeed, I cannot!’ said the Prince, and though he spoke with sufficient
      calmness and dignity, you could see that he was deeply pained, even
      distressed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, I’m—’ murmured Racksole, and stopped.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Seven NELLA AND THE PRINCE
    </h2>
<p>
      IT appeared impossible to Theodore Racksole that so cumbrous an article as
      a corpse could be removed out of his hotel, with no trace, no hint, no
      clue as to the time or the manner of the performance of the deed. After
      the first feeling of surprise, Racksole grew coldly and severely angry. He
      had a mind to dismiss the entire staff of the hotel. He personally
      examined the night-watchman, the chambermaids and all other persons who by
      chance might or ought to know something of the affair; but without avail.
      The corpse of Reginald Dimmock had vanished utterly—disappeared like
      a fleshless spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course there were the police. But Theodore Racksole held the police in
      sorry esteem. He acquainted them with the facts, answered their queries
      with a patient weariness, and expected nothing whatever from that
      quarter. He also had several interviews with Prince Aribert of Posen, but
      though the Prince was suavity itself and beyond doubt genuinely concerned
      about the fate of his dead attendant, yet it seemed to Racksole that he
      was keeping something back, that he hesitated to say all he knew.
      Racksole, with characteristic insight, decided that the death of Reginald
      Dimmock was only a minor event, which had occurred, as it were, on the
      fringe of some far more profound mystery. And, therefore, he decided to
      wait, with his eyes very wide open, until something else happened that
      would throw light on the business. At the moment he took only one measure—he
      arranged that the theft of Dimmock’s body should not appear in the
      newspapers. It is astonishing how well a secret can be kept, when the
      possessors of the secret are handled with the proper mixture of firmness
      and persuasion. Racksole managed this very neatly. It was a complicated
      job, and his success in it rather pleased him.
    </p>
<p>
      At the same time he was conscious of being temporarily worsted by an
      unknown group of schemers, in which he felt convinced that Jules was an
      important item. He could scarcely look Nella in the eyes. The girl had
      evidently expected him to unmask this conspiracy at once, with a single
      stroke of the millionaire’s magic wand. She was thoroughly accustomed, in
      the land of her birth, to seeing him achieve impossible feats. Over there
      he was a ‘boss’; men trembled before his name; when he wished a thing to
      happen—well, it happened; if he desired to know a thing, he just
      knew it. But here, in London, Theodore Racksole was not quite the same
      Theodore Racksole. He dominated New York; but London, for the most part,
      seemed not to take much interest in him; and there were certainly various
      persons in London who were capable of snapping their fingers at him—at
      Theodore Racksole. Neither he nor his daughter could get used to that
      fact.
    </p>
<p>
      As for Nella, she concerned herself for a little with the ordinary
      business of the bureau, and watched the incomings and outgoings of Prince
      Aribert with a kindly interest. She perceived, what her father had failed
      to perceive, that His Highness had assumed an attitude of reserve merely
      to hide the secret distraction and dismay which consumed him. She saw that
      the poor fellow had no settled plan in his head, and that he was troubled
      by something which, so far, he had confided to nobody. It came to her
      knowledge that each morning he walked to and fro on the Victoria
      Embankment, alone, and apparently with no object. On the third morning she
      decided that driving exercise on the Embankment would be good for her
      health, and thereupon ordered a carriage and issued forth, arrayed in a
      miraculous putty-coloured gown. Near Blackfriars Bridge she met the
      Prince, and the carriage was drawn up by the pavement.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good morning, Prince,’ she greeted him. ‘Are you mistaking this for Hyde
      Park?’
    </p>
<p>
      He bowed and smiled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I usually walk here in the mornings,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You surprise me,’ she returned. ‘I thought I was the only person in
      London who preferred the Embankment, with this view of the river, to the
      dustiness of Hyde Park. I can’t imagine how it is that London will never
      take exercise anywhere except in that ridiculous Park. Now, if they had
      Central Park—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think the Embankment is the finest spot in all London,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      She leaned a little out of the landau, bringing her face nearer to his.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do believe we are kindred spirits, you and I,’ she murmured; and then,
      ‘Au revoir, Prince!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One moment, Miss Racksole.’ His quick tones had a note of entreaty.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am in a hurry,’ she fibbed; ‘I am not merely taking exercise this
      morning. You have no idea how busy we are.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! then I will not trouble you. But I leave the Grand Babylon to-night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you?’ she said. ‘Then will your Highness do me the honour of lunching
      with me today in Father’s room? Father will be out—he is having a
      day in the City with some stockbroking persons.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall be charmed,’ said the Prince, and his face showed that he meant
      it.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella drove off.
    </p>
<p>
      If the lunch was a success that result was due partly to Rocco, and partly
      to Nella. The Prince said little beyond what the ordinary rules of the
      conversational game demanded. His hostess talked much and talked well, but
      she failed to rouse her guest. When they had had coffee he took a rather
      formal leave of her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good-bye, Prince,’ she said, ‘but I thought—that is, no I didn’t.
    </p>
<p>
      Good-bye.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You thought I wished to discuss something with you. I did; but I have
      decided that I have no right to burden your mind with my affairs.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But suppose—suppose I wish to be burdened?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is your good nature.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sit down,’ she said abruptly, ‘and tell me everything; mind, everything.
      I adore secrets.’
    </p>
<p>
      Almost before he knew it he was talking to her, rapidly, eagerly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why should I weary you with my confidences?’ he said. ‘I don’t know, I
      cannot tell; but I feel that I must. I feel that you will understand me
      better than anyone else in the world. And yet why should you understand
      me? Again, I don’t know. Miss Racksole, I will disclose to you the whole
      trouble in a word. Prince Eugen, the hereditary Grand Duke of Posen, has
      disappeared. Four days ago I was to have met him at Ostend. He had affairs
      in London. He wished me to come with him. I sent Dimmock on in front, and
      waited for Eugen. He did not arrive. I telegraphed back to Cologne, his
      last stopping-place, and I learned that he had left there in accordance
      with his programme; I learned also that he had passed through Brussels. It
      must have been between Brussels and the railway station at Ostend Quay
      that he disappeared. He was travelling with a single equerry, and the
      equerry, too, has vanished. I need not explain to you, Miss Racksole, that
      when a person of the importance of my nephew contrives to get lost one
      must proceed cautiously. One cannot advertise for him in the London Times.
      Such a disappearance must be kept secret. The people at Posen and at
      Berlin believe that Eugen is in London, here, at this hotel; or, rather,
      they did so believe. But this morning I received a cypher telegram from—from
      His Majesty the Emperor, a very peculiar telegram, asking when Eugen might
      be expected to return to Posen, and requesting that he should go first to
      Berlin. That telegram was addressed to myself. Now, if the Emperor thought
      that Eugen was here, why should he have caused the telegram to be
      addressed to me? I have hesitated for three days, but I can hesitate no
      longer. I must myself go to the Emperor and acquaint him with the facts.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose you’ve just got to keep straight with him?’ Nella was on the
      point of saying, but she checked herself and substituted, ‘The Emperor is
      your chief, is he not? “First among equals”, you call him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘His Majesty is our over-lord,’ said Aribert quietly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why do you not take immediate steps to inquire as to the whereabouts of
      your Royal nephew?’ she asked simply. The affair seemed to her just then
      so plain and straightforward.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because one of two things may have happened. Either Eugen may have been,
      in plain language, abducted, or he may have had his own reasons for
      changing his programme and keeping in the background—out of reach of
      telegraph and post and railways.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What sort of reasons?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do not ask me. In the history of every family there are passages—’
      He stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And what was Prince Eugen’s object in coming to London?’
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert hesitated.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Money,’ he said at length. ‘As a family we are very poor—poorer
      than anyone in Berlin suspects.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Prince Aribert,’ Nella said, ‘shall I tell you what I think?’ She leaned
      back in her chair, and looked at him out of half-closed eyes. His pale,
      thin, distinguished face held her gaze as if by some fascination. There
      could be no mistaking this man for anything else but a Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you will,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Prince Eugen is the victim of a plot.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You think so?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am perfectly convinced of it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But why? What can be the object of a plot against him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is a point of which you should know more than me,’ she remarked
      drily.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! Perhaps, perhaps,’ he said. ‘But, dear Miss Racksole, why are you so
      sure?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There are several reasons, and they are connected with Mr Dimmock. Did
      you ever suspect, your Highness, that that poor young man was not entirely
      loyal to you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He was absolutely loyal,’ said the Prince, with all the earnestness of
      conviction.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A thousand pardons, but he was not.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Racksole, if any other than yourself made that assertion, I would—I
      would—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Consign them to the deepest dungeon in Posen?’ she laughed, lightly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Listen.’ And she told him of the incidents which had occurred in the
      night preceding his arrival in the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you mean, Miss Racksole, that there was an understanding between poor
      Dimmock and this fellow Jules?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There was an understanding.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Impossible!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your Highness, the man who wishes to probe a mystery to its root never
      uses the word “impossible”. But I will say this for young Mr Dimmock. I
      think he repented, and I think that it was because he repented that he—er—died
      so suddenly, and that his body was spirited away.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why has no one told me these things before?’ Aribert exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Princes seldom hear the truth,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      He was astonished at her coolness, her firmness of assertion, her air of
      complete acquaintance with the world.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Racksole,’ he said, ‘if you will permit me to say it, I have never
      in my life met a woman like you. May I rely on your sympathy—your
      support?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My support, Prince? But how?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not know,’ he replied. ‘But you could help me if you would. A woman,
      when she has brain, always has more brain than a man.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ she said ruefully, ‘I have no brains, but I do believe I could help
      you.’
    </p>
<p>
      What prompted her to make that assertion she could not have explained,
      even to herself. But she made it, and she had a suspicion—a
      prescience—that it would be justified, though by what means, through
      what good fortune, was still a mystery to her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Go to Berlin,’ she said. ‘I see that you must do that; you have no
      alternative. As for the rest, we shall see. Something will occur. I shall
      be here. My father will be here. You must count us as your friends.’
    </p>
<p>
      He kissed her hand when he left, and afterwards, when she was alone, she
      kissed the spot his lips had touched again and again. Now, thinking the
      matter out in the calmness of solitude, all seemed strange, unreal,
      uncertain to her. Were conspiracies actually possible nowadays? Did queer
      things actually happen in Europe? And did they actually happen in London
      hotels? She dined with her father that night.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I hear Prince Aribert has left,’ said Theodore Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ she assented. She said not a word about their interview.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Eight ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF THE BARONESS
    </h2>
<p>
      ON the following morning, just before lunch, a lady, accompanied by a maid
      and a considerable quantity of luggage, came to the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel.
      She was a plump, little old lady, with white hair and an old-fashioned
      bonnet, and she had a quaint, simple smile of surprise at everything in
      general.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, she gave the impression of belonging to some aristocracy,
      though not the English aristocracy. Her tone to her maid, whom she
      addressed in broken English—the girl being apparently English—was
      distinctly insolent, with the calm, unconscious insolence peculiar to a
      certain type of Continental nobility. The name on the lady’s card ran
      thus: ‘Baroness Zerlinski’. She desired rooms on the third floor. It
      happened that Nella was in the bureau.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘On the third floor, madam?’ questioned Nella, in her best clerkly manner.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I did say on de tird floor,’ said the plump little old lady.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We have accommodation on the second floor.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I wish to be high up, out of de dust and in de light,’ explained the
      Baroness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We have no suites on the third floor, madam.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never mind, no mattaire! Have you not two rooms that communicate?’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella consulted her books, rather awkwardly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Numbers 122 and 123 communicate.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Or is it 121 and 122?’ the little old lady remarked quickly, and then bit
      her lip.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I beg your pardon. I should have said 121 and 122.’
    </p>
<p>
      At the moment Nella regarded the Baroness’s correction of her figures as a
      curious chance, but afterwards, when the Baroness had ascended in the
      lift, the thing struck her as somewhat strange. Perhaps the Baroness
      Zerlinski had stayed at the hotel before. For the sake of convenience an
      index of visitors to the hotel was kept and the index extended back for
      thirty years. Nella examined it, but it did not contain the name of
      Zerlinski. Then it was that Nella began to imagine, what had swiftly
      crossed her mind when first the Baroness presented herself at the bureau,
      that the features of the Baroness were remotely familiar to her. She
      thought, not that she had seen the old lady’s face before, but that she
      had seen somewhere, some time, a face of a similar cast. It occurred to
      Nella to look at the ‘Almanach de Gotha’—that record of all the
      mazes of Continental blue blood; but the ‘Almanach de Gotha’ made no
      reference to any barony of Zerlinski. Nella inquired where the Baroness
      meant to take lunch, and was informed that a table had been reserved for
      her in the dining-room, and she at once decided to lunch in the
      dining-room herself. Seated in a corner, half-hidden by a pillar, she
      could survey all the guests, and watch each group as it entered or left.
      Presently the Baroness appeared, dressed in black, with a tiny lace shawl,
      despite the June warmth; very stately, very quaint, and gently smiling.
      Nella observed her intently. The lady ate heartily, working without haste
      and without delay through the elaborate menu of the luncheon. Nella
      noticed that she had beautiful white teeth. Then a remarkable thing
      happened. A cream puff was served to the Baroness by way of sweets, and
      Nella was astonished to see the little lady remove the top, and with a
      spoon quietly take something from the interior which looked like a piece
      of folded paper. No one who had not been watching with the eye of a lynx
      would have noticed anything extraordinary in the action; indeed, the
      chances were nine hundred and ninety-nine to one that it would pass
      unheeded. But, unfortunately for the Baroness, it was the thousandth
      chance that happened. Nella jumped up, and walking over to the Baroness,
      said to her:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m afraid that the tart is not quite nice, your ladyship.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thanks, it is delightful,’ said the Baroness coldly; her smile had
      vanished. ‘Who are you? I thought you were de bureau clerk.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My father is the owner of this hotel. I thought there was something in
      the tart which ought not to have been there.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella looked the Baroness full in the face. The piece of folded paper, to
      which a little cream had attached itself, lay under the edge of a plate.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, thanks.’ The Baroness smiled her simple smile.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella departed. She had noticed one trifling thing besides the paper—namely,
      that the Baroness could pronounce the English ‘th’ sound if she chose.
    </p>
<p>
      That afternoon, in her own room, Nella sat meditating at the window for
      long time, and then she suddenly sprang up, her eyes brightening.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I know,’ she exclaimed, clapping her hands. ‘It’s Miss Spencer,
      disguised!
    </p>
<p>
      Why didn’t I think of that before?’ Her thoughts ran instantly to Prince
      Aribert. ‘Perhaps I can help him,’ she said to herself, and gave a little
      sigh. She went down to the office and inquired whether the Baroness had
      given any instructions about dinner. She felt that some plan must be
      formulated. She wanted to get hold of Rocco, and put him in the rack. She
      knew now that Rocco, the unequalled, was also concerned in this mysterious
      affair.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Baroness Zerlinski has left, about a quarter of an hour ago,’ said
      the attendant.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But she only arrived this morning.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Baroness’s maid said that her mistress had received a telegram and
      must leave at once. The Baroness paid the bill, and went away in a
      four-wheeler.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where to?’
    </p>
<p>
     ‘The trunks were labelled for Ostend.’
</p>
<p>
      Perhaps it was instinct, perhaps it was the mere spirit of adventure; but
      that evening Nella was to be seen of all men on the steamer for Ostend
      which leaves Dover at 11 p.m. She told no one of her intentions—not
      even her father, who was not in the hotel when she left. She had scribbled
      a brief note to him to expect her back in a day or two, and had posted
      this at Dover. The steamer was the Marie Henriette, a large and luxurious
      boat, whose state-rooms on deck vie with the glories of the Cunard and
      White Star liners. One of these state-rooms, the best, was evidently
      occupied, for every curtain of its windows was carefully drawn. Nella did
      not hope that the Baroness was on board; it was quite possible for the
      Baroness to have caught the eight o’clock steamer, and it was also
      possible for the Baroness not to have gone to Ostend at all, but to some
      other place in an entirely different direction. Nevertheless, Nella had a
      faint hope that the lady who called herself Zerlinski might be in that
      curtained stateroom, and throughout the smooth moonlit voyage she never
      once relaxed her observation of its doors and its windows.
    </p>
<p>
      The Maria Henriette arrived in Ostend Harbour punctually at 2 a.m. in the
      morning. There was the usual heterogeneous, gesticulating crowd on the
      quay.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella kept her post near the door of the state-room, and at length she was
      rewarded by seeing it open. Four middle-aged Englishmen issued from it.
      From a glimpse of the interior Nella saw that they had spent the voyage in
      card-playing.
    </p>
<p>
      It would not be too much to say that she was distinctly annoyed. She
      pretended to be annoyed with circumstances, but really she was annoyed
      with Nella Racksole. At two in the morning, without luggage, without any
      companionship, and without a plan of campaign, she found herself in a
      strange foreign port—a port of evil repute, possessing some of the
      worst-managed hotels in Europe. She strolled on the quay for a few
      minutes, and then she saw the smoke of another steamer in the offing. She
      inquired from an official what that steamer might be, and was told that it
      was the eight o’clock from Dover, which had broken down, put into Calais
      for some slight necessary repairs, and was arriving at its destination
      nearly four hours late. Her mercurial spirits rose again. A minute ago she
      was regarding herself as no better than a ninny engaged in a wild-goose
      chase. Now she felt that after all she had been very sagacious and
      cunning. She was morally sure that she would find the Zerlinski woman on
      this second steamer, and she took all the credit to herself in advance.
      Such is human nature.
    </p>
<p>
      The steamer seemed interminably slow in coming into harbour. Nella walked
      on the Digue for a few minutes to watch it the better. The town was silent
      and almost deserted. It had a false and sinister aspect. She remembered
      tales which she had heard of this glittering resort, which in the season
      holds more scoundrels than any place in Europe, save only Monte Carlo. She
      remembered that the gilded adventurers of every nation under the sun
      forgathered there either for business or pleasure, and that some of the
      most wonderful crimes of the latter half of the century had been schemed
      and matured in that haunt of cosmopolitan iniquity.
    </p>
<p>
      When the second steamer arrived Nella stood at the end of the gangway,
      close to the ticket-collector. The first person to step on shore was—not
      the Baroness Zerlinski, but Miss Spencer herself! Nella turned aside
      instantly, hiding her face, and Miss Spencer, carrying a small bag,
      hurried with assured footsteps to the Custom House. It seemed as if she
      knew the port of Ostend fairly well. The moon shone like day, and Nella
      had full opportunity to observe her quarry. She could see now quite
      plainly that the Baroness Zerlinski had been only Miss Spencer in
      disguise. There was the same gait, the same movement of the head and of
      the hips; the white hair was easily to be accounted for by a wig, and the
      wrinkles by a paint brush and some grease paints. Miss Spencer, whose hair
      was now its old accustomed yellow, got through the Custom House without
      difficulty, and Nella saw her call a closed carriage and say something to
      the driver. The vehicle drove off. Nella jumped into the next carriage—an
      open one—that came up.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Follow that carriage,’ she said succinctly to the driver in French.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Bien, madame!’ The driver whipped up his horse, and the animal shot
      forward with a terrific clatter over the cobbles. It appeared that this
      driver was quite accustomed to following other carriages.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now I am fairly in for it!’ said Nella to herself. She laughed
      unsteadily, but her heart was beating with an extraordinary thump.
    </p>
<p>
      For some time the pursued vehicle kept well in front. It crossed the town
      nearly from end to end, and plunged into a maze of small streets far on
      the south side of the Kursaal. Then gradually Nella’s equipage began to
      overtake it. The first carriage stopped with a jerk before a tall dark
      house, and Miss Spencer emerged. Nella called to her driver to stop, but
      he, determined to be in at the death, was engaged in whipping his horse,
      and he completely ignored her commands. He drew up triumphantly at the
      tall dark house just at the moment when Miss Spencer disappeared into it.
      The other carriage drove away. Nella, uncertain what to do, stepped down
      from her carriage and gave the driver some money. At the same moment a man
      reopened the door of the house, which had closed on Miss Spencer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want to see Miss Spencer,’ said Nella impulsively. She couldn’t think
      of anything else to say.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Spencer?’
</p>
<p>
    ‘Yes; she’s just arrived.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s O.K., I suppose,’ said the man.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I guess so,’ said Nella, and she walked past him into the house. She was
      astonished at her own audacity.
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer was just going into a room off the narrow hall. Nella
      followed her into the apartment, which was shabbily furnished in the
      Belgian lodging-house style.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, Miss Spencer,’ she greeted the former Baroness Zerlinski, ‘I guess
      you didn’t expect to see me. You left our hotel very suddenly this
      afternoon, and you left it very suddenly a few days ago; and so I’ve just
      called to make a few inquiries.’
    </p>
<p>
      To do the lady justice, Miss Spencer bore the surprising ordeal very well.
    </p>
<p>
      She did not flinch; she betrayed no emotion. The sole sign of perturbation
      was in her hurried breathing.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have ceased to be the Baroness Zerlinski,’ Nella continued. ‘May I
      sit down?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly, sit down,’ said Miss Spencer, copying the girl’s tone. ‘You
      are a fairly smart young woman, that I will say. What do you want? Weren’t
      my books all straight?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your books were all straight. I haven’t come about your books. I have
      come about the murder of Reginald Dimmock, the disappearance of his
      corpse, and the disappearance of Prince Eugen of Posen. I thought you
      might be able to help me in some investigations which I am making.’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer’s eyes gleamed, and she stood up and moved swiftly to the
      mantelpiece.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You may be a Yankee, but you’re a fool,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      She took hold of the bell-rope.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t ring that bell if you value your life,’ said Nella.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If what?’ Miss Spencer remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you value your life,’ said Nella calmly, and with the words she pulled
      from her pocket a very neat and dainty little revolver.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Nine TWO WOMEN AND THE REVOLVER
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘YOU—you’re only doing that to frighten me,’ stammered Miss Spencer,
      in a low, quavering voice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Am I?’ Nella replied, as firmly as she could, though her hand shook
      violently with excitement, could Miss Spencer but have observed it. ‘Am I?
      You said just now that I might be a Yankee girl, but I was a fool. Well, I
      am a Yankee girl, as you call it; and in my country, if they don’t teach
      revolver-shooting in boarding-schools, there are at least a lot of girls
      who can handle a revolver. I happen to be one of them. I tell you that if
      you ring that bell you will suffer.’
    </p>
<p>
      Most of this was simple bluff on Nella’s part, and she trembled lest Miss
      Spencer should perceive that it was simple bluff. Happily for her, Miss
      Spencer belonged to that order of women who have every sort of courage
      except physical courage. Miss Spencer could have withstood successfully
      any moral trial, but persuade her that her skin was in danger, and she
      would succumb. Nella at once divined this useful fact, and proceeded
      accordingly, hiding the strangeness of her own sensations as well as she
      could.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You had better sit down now,’ said Nella, ‘and I will ask you a few
      questions.’
    </p>
<p>
      And Miss Spencer obediently sat down, rather white, and trying to screw
      her lips into a formal smile.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you leave the Grand Babylon that night?’ Nella began her
      examination, putting on a stern, barrister-like expression.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had orders to, Miss Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Whose orders?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, I’m—I’m—the fact is, I’m a married woman, and it was my
      husband’s orders.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who is your husband?’
</p>
<p>
‘Tom Jackson—Jules, you know, head waiter at
      the Grand Babylon.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So Jules’s real name is Tom Jackson? Why did he want you to leave without
      giving notice?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m sure I don’t know, Miss Racksole. I swear I don’t know. He’s my
      husband, and, of course, I do what he tells me, as you will some day do
      what your husband tells you. Please heaven you’ll get a better husband
      than mine!’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer showed a sign of tears.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella fingered the revolver, and put it at full cock. ‘Well,’ she
      repeated, ‘why did he want you to leave?’ She was tremendously surprised
      at her own coolness, and somewhat pleased with it, too.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can’t tell you, I can’t tell you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’ve just got to,’ Nella said, in a terrible, remorseless tone.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He—he wished me to come over here to Ostend. Something had gone
      wrong.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh! he’s a fearful man, is Tom. If I told you, he’d—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Had something gone wrong in the hotel, or over here?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Both.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Was it about Prince Eugen of Posen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know—that is, yes, I think so.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What has your husband to do with Prince Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I believe he has some—some sort of business with him, some money
      business.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And was Mr Dimmock in this business?’
</p>
<p>
‘I fancy so, Miss Racksole. I’m
      telling you all I know, that I swear.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did your husband and Mr Dimmock have a quarrel that night in Room 111?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They had some difficulty.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And the result of that was that you came to Ostend instantly?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes; I suppose so.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And what were you to do in Ostend? What were your instructions from this
      husband of yours?’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer’s head dropped on her arms on the table which separated her
      from Nella, and she appeared to sob violently.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have pity on me,’ she murmured, ‘I can’t tell you any more.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He’d kill me if he knew.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’re wandering from the subject,’ observed Nella coldly. ‘This is the
      last time I shall warn you. Let me tell you plainly I’ve got the best
      reasons for being desperate, and if anything happens to you I shall say I
      did it in self-defence. Now, what were you to do in Ostend?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall die for this anyhow,’ whined Miss Spencer, and then, with a sort
      of fierce despair, ‘I had to keep watch on Prince Eugen.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where? In this house?’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer nodded, and, looking up, Nella could see the traces of tears
      in her face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then Prince Eugen was a prisoner? Some one had captured him at the
      instigation of Jules?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, if you must have it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why was it necessary for you specially to come to Ostend?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! Tom trusts me. You see, I know Ostend. Before I took that place at
      the Grand Babylon I had travelled over Europe, and Tom knew that I knew a
      thing or two.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you take the place at the Grand Babylon?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because Tom told me to. He said I should be useful to him there.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is your husband an Anarchist, or something of that kind, Miss Spencer?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know. I’d tell you in a minute if I knew. But he’s one of those
      that keep themselves to themselves.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you know if he has ever committed a murder?’
</p>
<p>
‘Never!’ said Miss
      Spencer, with righteous repudiation of the mere idea.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But Mr Dimmock was murdered. He was poisoned. If he had not been poisoned
      why was his body stolen? It must have been stolen to prevent inquiry, to
      hide traces. Tell me about that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I take my dying oath,’ said Miss Spencer, standing up a little way from
      the table, ‘I take my dying oath I didn’t know Mr Dimmock was dead till I
      saw it in the newspaper.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You swear you had no suspicion of it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I swear I hadn’t.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella was inclined to believe the statement. The woman and the girl looked
      at each other in the tawdry, frowsy, lamp-lit room. Miss Spencer nervously
      patted her yellow hair into shape, as if gradually recovering her
      composure and equanimity. The whole affair seemed like a dream to Nella, a
      disturbing, sinister nightmare. She was a little uncertain what to say.
      She felt that she had not yet got hold of any very definite information.
      ‘Where is Prince Eugen now?’ she asked at length.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know, miss.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He isn’t in this house?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, miss.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! We will see presently.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They took him away, Miss Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who took him away? Some of your husband’s friends?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Some of his—acquaintances.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then there is a gang of you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A gang of us—a gang! I don’t know what you mean,’ Miss Spencer
      quavered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, but you must know,’ smiled Nella calmly. ‘You can’t possibly be so
      innocent as all that, Mrs Tom Jackson. You can’t play games with me.
      You’ve just got to remember that I’m what you call a Yankee girl. There’s
      one thing that I mean to find out, within the next five minutes, and that
      is—how your charming husband kidnapped Prince Eugen, and why he
      kidnapped him. Let us begin with the second question. You have evaded it
      once.’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer looked into Nella’s face, and then her eyes dropped, and her
      fingers worked nervously with the tablecloth.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How can I tell you,’ she said, ‘when I don’t know? You’ve got the
      whip-hand of me, and you’re tormenting me for your own pleasure.’ She wore
      an expression of persecuted innocence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did Mr Tom Jackson want to get some money out of Prince Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Money! Not he! Tom’s never short of money.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But I mean a lot of money—tens of thousands, hundreds of
      thousands?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tom never wanted money from anyone,’ said Miss Spencer doggedly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then had he some reason for wishing to prevent Prince Eugen from coming
      to London?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps he had. I don’t know. If you kill me, I don’t know.’ Nella
      stopped to reflect. Then she raised the revolver. It was a mechanical,
      unintentional sort of action, and certainly she had no intention of using
      the weapon, but, strange to say, Miss Spencer again cowered before it.
      Even at that moment Nella wondered that a woman like Miss Spencer could be
      so simple as to think the revolver would actually be used. Having
      absolutely no physical cowardice herself, Nella had the greatest
      difficulty in imagining that other people could be at the mercy of a
      bodily fear. Still, she saw her advantage, and used it relentlessly, and
      with as much theatrical gesture as she could command. She raised the
      revolver till it was level with Miss Spencer’s face, and suddenly a new,
      queer feeling took hold of her. She knew that she would indeed use that
      revolver now, if the miserable woman before her drove her too far. She
      felt afraid—afraid of herself; she was in the grasp of a savage,
      primeval instinct. In a flash she saw Miss Spencer dead at her feet—the
      police—a court of justice—the scaffold. It was horrible.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Speak,’ she said hoarsely, and Miss Spencer’s face went whiter.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tom did say,’ the woman whispered rapidly, awesomely, ‘that if Prince
      Eugen got to London it would upset his scheme.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What scheme? What scheme? Answer me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Heaven help me, I don’t know.’ Miss Spencer sank into a chair. ‘He said
      Mr Dimmock had turned tail, and he should have to settle him and then
      Rocco—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rocco! What about Rocco?’ Nella could scarcely hear herself. Her grip of
      the revolver tightened.
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer’s eyes opened wider; she gazed at Nella with a glassy stare.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t ask me. It’s death!’ Her eyes were fixed as if in horror.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is,’ said Nella, and the sound of her voice seemed to her to issue
      from the lips of some third person.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s death,’ repeated Miss Spencer, and gradually her head and shoulders
      sank back, and hung loosely over the chair. Nella was conscious of a
      sudden revulsion. The woman had surely fainted. Dropping the revolver she
      ran round the table. She was herself again—feminine, sympathetic,
      the old Nella. She felt immensely relieved that this had happened. But at
      the same instant Miss Spencer sprang up from the chair like a cat, seized
      the revolver, and with a wild movement of the arm flung it against the
      window. It crashed through the glass, exploding as it went, and there was
      a tense silence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I told you that you were a fool,’ remarked Miss Spencer slowly, ‘coming
      here like a sort of female Jack Sheppard, and trying to get the best of
      me.
    </p>
<p>
      We are on equal terms now. You frightened me, but I knew I was a cleverer
      woman than you, and that in the end, if I kept on long enough, I should
      win.
    </p>
<p>
      Now it will be my turn.’
    </p>
<p>
      Dumbfounded, and overcome with a miserable sense of the truth of Miss
      Spencer’s words, Nella stood still. The idea of her colossal foolishness
      swept through her like a flood. She felt almost ashamed. But even at this
      juncture she had no fear. She faced the woman bravely, her mind leaping
      about in search of some plan. She could think of nothing but a bribe—an
      enormous bribe.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I admit you’ve won,’ she said, ‘but I’ve not finished yet. Just listen.’
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer folded her arms, and glanced at the door, smiling bitterly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You know my father is a millionaire; perhaps you know that he is one of
      the richest men in the world. If I give you my word of honour not to
      reveal anything that you’ve told me, what will you take to let me go
      free?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What sum do you suggest?’ asked Miss Spencer carelessly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Twenty thousand pounds,’ said Nella promptly. She had begun to regard the
      affair as a business operation.
    </p>
<p>
      Miss Spencer’s lip curled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A hundred thousand.’
    </p>
<p>
      Again Miss Spencer’s lip curled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, say a million. I can rely on my father, and so may you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You think you are worth a million to him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do,’ said Nella.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you think we could trust you to see that it was paid?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of course you could.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And we should not suffer afterwards in any way?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I would give you my word, and my father’s word.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Bah!’ exclaimed Miss Spencer: ‘how do you know I wouldn’t let you go free
      for nothing? You are only a rash, silly girl.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I know you wouldn’t. I can read your face too well.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are right,’ Miss Spencer replied slowly. ‘I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t let
      you go for all the dollars in America.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella felt cold down the spine, and sat down again in her chair. A draught
      of air from the broken window blew on her cheek. Steps sounded in the
      passage; the door opened, but Nella did not turn round. She could not move
      her eyes from Miss Spencer’s. There was a noise of rushing water in her
      ears. She lost consciousness, and slipped limply to the ground.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Ten AT SEA
    </h2>
<p>
      IT seemed to Nella that she was being rocked gently in a vast cradle,
      which swayed to and fro with a motion at once slow and incredibly gentle.
      This sensation continued for some time, and there was added to it the
      sound of a quick, quiet, muffled beat. Soft, exhilarating breezes wafted
      her forward in spite of herself, and yet she remained in a delicious calm.
      She wondered if her mother was kneeling by her side, whispering some
      lullaby in her childish ears. Then strange colours swam before her eyes,
      her eyelids wavered, and at last she awoke. For a few moments her gaze
      travelled to and fro in a vain search for some clue to her surroundings,
      was aware of nothing except sense of repose and a feeling of relief that
      some mighty and fatal struggle was over; she cared not whether she had
      conquered or suffered defeat in the struggle of her soul with some other
      soul; it was finished, done with, and the consciousness of its conclusion
      satisfied and contented her. Gradually her brain, recovering from its
      obsession, began to grasp the phenomena of her surroundings, and she saw
      that she was on a yacht, and that the yacht was moving. The motion of the
      cradle was the smooth rolling of the vessel; the beat was the beat of its
      screw; the strange colours were the cloud tints thrown by the sun as it
      rose over a distant and receding shore in the wake of the yacht; her
      mother’s lullaby was the crooned song of the man at the wheel. Nella all
      through her life had had many experiences of yachting. From the waters of
      the River Hudson to those bluer tides of the Mediterranean Sea, she had
      yachted in all seasons and all weathers. She loved the water, and now it
      seemed deliciously right and proper that she should be on the water again.
      She raised her head to look round, and then let it sink back: she was
      fatigued, enervated; she desired only solitude and calm; she had no care,
      no anxiety, no responsibility: a hundred years might have passed since her
      meeting with Miss Spencer, and the memory of that meeting appeared to have
      faded into the remotest background of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a small yacht, and her practised eye at once told that it belonged
      to the highest aristocracy of pleasure craft. As she reclined in the
      deck-chair (it did not occur to her at that moment to speculate as to the
      identity of the person who had led her therein) she examined all visible
      details of the vessel. The deck was as white and smooth as her own hand,
      and the seams ran along its length like blue veins. All the brass-work,
      from the band round the slender funnel to the concave surface of the
      binnacle, shone like gold.
    </p>
<p>
      The tapered masts stretched upwards at a rakish angle, and the rigging
      seemed like spun silk. No sails were set; the yacht was under steam, and
      doing about seven or eight knots. She judged that it was a boat of a
      hundred tons or so, probably Clyde-built, and not more than two or three
      years old.
    </p>
<p>
      No one was to be seen on deck except the man at the wheel: this man wore a
      blue jersey; but there was neither name nor initial on the jersey, nor was
      there a name on the white life-buoys lashed to the main rigging, nor on
      the polished dinghy which hung on the starboard davits. She called to the
      man, and called again, in a feeble voice, but the steerer took no notice
      of her, and continued his quiet song as though nothing else existed in the
      universe save the yacht, the sea, the sun, and himself.
    </p>
<p>
      Then her eyes swept the outline of the land from which they were
      hastening, and she could just distinguish a lighthouse and a great white
      irregular dome, which she recognized as the Kursaal at Ostend, that
      gorgeous rival of the gaming palace at Monte Carlo. So she was leaving
      Ostend. The rays of the sun fell on her caressingly, like a restorative.
      All around the water was changing from wonderful greys and dark blues to
      still more wonderful pinks and translucent unearthly greens; the magic
      kaleidoscope of dawn was going forward in its accustomed way, regardless
      of the vicissitudes of mortals.
    </p>
<p>
      Here and there in the distance she descried a sail—the brown sail of
      some Ostend fishing-boat returning home after a night’s trawling. Then the
      beat of paddles caught her ear, and a steamer blundered past, wallowing
      clumsily among the waves like a tortoise. It was the Swallow from London.
      She could see some of its passengers leaning curiously over the aft-rail.
      A girl in a mackintosh signalled to her, and mechanically she answered the
      salute with her arm. The officer of the bridge of the Swallow hailed the
      yacht, but the man at the wheel offered no reply. In another minute the
      Swallow was nothing but a blot in the distance.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella tried to sit straight in the deck-chair, but she found herself
      unable to do so. Throwing off the rug which covered her, she discovered
      that she had been tied to the chair by means of a piece of broad webbing.
      Instantly she was alert, awake, angry; she knew that her perils were not
      over; she felt that possibly they had scarcely yet begun. Her lazy
      contentment, her dreamy sense of peace and repose, vanished utterly, and
      she steeled herself to meet the dangers of a grave and difficult
      situation.
    </p>
<p>
      Just at that moment a man came up from below. He was a man of forty or so,
      clad in irreproachable blue, with a peaked yachting cap. He raised the cap
      politely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good morning,’ he said. ‘Beautiful sunrise, isn’t it?’ The clever and
      calculated insolence of his tone cut her like a lash as she lay bound in
      the chair. Like all people who have lived easy and joyous lives in those
      fair regions where gold smoothes every crease and law keeps a tight hand
      on disorder, she found it hard to realize that there were other regions
      where gold was useless and law without power. Twenty-four hours ago she
      would have declared it impossible that such an experience as she had
      suffered could happen to anyone; she would have talked airily about
      civilization and the nineteenth century, and progress and the police. But
      her experience was teaching her that human nature remains always the same,
      and that beneath the thin crust of security on which we good citizens
      exist the dark and secret forces of crime continue to move, just as they
      did in the days when you couldn’t go from Cheapside to Chelsea without
      being set upon by thieves. Her experience was in a fair way to teach her
      this lesson better than she could have learnt it even in the bureaux of
      the detective police of Paris, London, and St Petersburg.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good morning,’ the man repeated, and she glanced at him with a sullen,
      angry gaze.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You!’ she exclaimed, ‘You, Mr Thomas Jackson, if that is your name! Loose
      me from this chair, and I will talk to you.’ Her eyes flashed as she
      spoke, and the contempt in them added mightily to her beauty. Mr Thomas
      Jackson, otherwise Jules, erstwhile head waiter at the Grand Babylon,
      considered himself a connoisseur in feminine loveliness, and the vision of
      Nella Racksole smote him like an exquisite blow.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With pleasure,’ he replied. ‘I had forgotten that to prevent you from
      falling I had secured you to the chair’; and with a quick movement he
      unfastened the band. Nella stood up, quivering with fiery annoyance and
      scorn.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now,’ she said, fronting him, ‘what is the meaning of this?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You fainted,’ he replied imperturbably. ‘Perhaps you don’t remember.’
    </p>
<p>
      The man offered her a deck-chair with a characteristic gesture. Nella was
      obliged to acknowledge, in spite of herself, that the fellow had
      distinction, an air of breeding. No one would have guessed that for twenty
      years he had been an hotel waiter. His long, lithe figure, and easy,
      careless carriage seemed to be the figure and carriage of an aristocrat,
      and his voice was quiet, restrained, and authoritative.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That has nothing to do with my being carried off in this yacht of yours.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is not my yacht,’ he said, ‘but that is a minor detail. As to the more
      important matter, forgive me that I remind you that only a few hours ago
      you were threatening a lady in my house with a revolver.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then it was your house?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not? May I not possess a house?’ He smiled.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must request you to put the yacht about at once, instantly, and take me
      back.’ She tried to speak firmly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ he said, ‘I am afraid that’s impossible. I didn’t put out to sea
      with the intention of returning at once, instantly.’ In the last words he
      gave a faint imitation of her tone.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘When I do get back,’ she said, ‘when my father gets to know of this
      affair, it will be an exceedingly bad day for you, Mr Jackson.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But supposing your father doesn’t hear of it—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Supposing you never get back?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you mean, then, to have my murder on your conscience?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Talking of murder,’ he said, ‘you came very near to murdering my friend,
      Miss Spencer. At least, so she tells me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is Miss Spencer on board?’ Nella asked, seeing perhaps a faint ray of
      hope in the possible presence of a woman.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Miss Spencer is not on board. There is no one on board except you and
      myself and a small crew—a very discreet crew, I may add.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will have nothing more to say to you. You must take your own course.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thanks for the permission,’ he said. ‘I will send you up some breakfast.’
    </p>
<p>
      He went to the saloon stairs and whistled, and a Negro boy appeared with a
      tray of chocolate. Nella took it, and, without the slightest hesitation,
      threw it overboard. Mr Jackson walked away a few steps and then returned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have spirit,’ he said, ‘and I admire spirit. It is a rare quality.’
    </p>
<p>
      She made no reply. ‘Why did you mix yourself up in my affairs at all?’ he
      went on. Again she made no reply, but the question set her thinking: why
      had she mixed herself up in this mysterious business? It was quite at
      variance with the usual methods of her gay and butterfly existence to
      meddle at all with serious things. Had she acted merely from a desire to
      see justice done and wickedness punished? Or was it the desire of
      adventure? Or was it, perhaps, the desire to be of service to His Serene
      Highness Prince Aribert? ‘It is no fault of mine that you are in this
      fix,’ Jules continued. ‘I didn’t bring you into it. You brought yourself
      into it. You and your father—you have been moving along at a pace
      which is rather too rapid.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That remains to be seen,’ she put in coldly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It does,’ he admitted. ‘And I repeat that I can’t help admiring you—that
      is, when you aren’t interfering with my private affairs. That is a
      proceeding which I have never tolerated from anyone—not even from a
      millionaire, nor even from a beautiful woman.’ He bowed. ‘I will tell you
      what I propose to do. I propose to escort you to a place of safety, and to
      keep you there till my operations are concluded, and the possibility of
      interference entirely removed. You spoke just now of murder. What a crude
      notion that was of yours! It is only the amateur who practises murder—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What about Reginald Dimmock?’ she interjected quickly.
    </p>
<p>
      He paused gravely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Reginald Dimmock,’ he repeated. ‘I had imagined his was a case of heart
      disease. Let me send you up some more chocolate. I’m sure you’re hungry.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will starve before I touch your food,’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Gallant creature!’ he murmured, and his eyes roved over her face. Her
      superb, supercilious beauty overcame him. ‘Ah!’ he said, ‘what a wife you
      would make!’ He approached nearer to her. ‘You and I, Miss Racksole, your
      beauty and wealth and my brains—we could conquer the world. Few men
      are worthy of you, but I am one of the few. Listen! You might do worse.
      Marry me. I am a great man; I shall be greater. I adore you. Marry me, and
      I will save your life. All shall be well. I will begin again. The past
      shall be as though there had been no past.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is somewhat sudden—Jules,’ she said with biting contempt.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did you expect me to be conventional?’ he retorted. ‘I love you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Granted,’ she said, for the sake of the argument. ‘Then what will occur
      to your present wife?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My present wife?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, Miss Spencer, as she is called.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She told you I was her husband?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Incidentally she did.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She isn’t.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps she isn’t. But, nevertheless, I think I won’t marry you.’ Nella
      stood like a statue of scorn before him.
    </p>
<p>
      He went still nearer to her. ‘Give me a kiss, then; one kiss—I won’t
      ask for more; one kiss from those lips, and you shall go free. Men have
      ruined themselves for a kiss. I will.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Coward!’ she ejaculated.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Coward!’ he repeated. ‘Coward, am I? Then I’ll be a coward, and you shall
      kiss me whether you will or not.’
    </p>
<p>
      He put a hand on her shoulder. As she shrank back from his lustrous eyes,
      with an involuntary scream, a figure sprang out of the dinghy a few feet
      away. With a single blow, neatly directed to Mr Jackson’s ear, Mr Jackson
      was stretched senseless on the deck. Prince Aribert of Posen stood over
      him with a revolver. It was probably the greatest surprise of Mr Jackson’s
      whole life.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t be alarmed,’ said the Prince to Nella, ‘my being here is the
      simplest thing in the world, and I will explain it as soon as I have
      finished with this fellow.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella could think of nothing to say, but she noticed the revolver in the
      Prince’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why,’ she remarked, ‘that’s my revolver.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is,’ he said, ‘and I will explain that, too.’
    </p>
<p>
      The man at the wheel gave no heed whatever to the scene.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Eleven THE COURT PAWNBROKER
    </h2>
<h3>
      ‘MR SAMPSON LEVI wishes to see you, sir.’
    </h3>
<p>
      These words, spoken by a servant to Theodore Racksole, aroused the
      millionaire from a reverie which had been the reverse of pleasant. The
      fact was, and it is necessary to insist on it, that Mr Racksole, owner of
      the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel, was by no means in a state of self-satisfaction.
      A mystery had attached itself to his hotel, and with all his acumen and
      knowledge of things in general he was unable to solve that mystery. He
      laughed at the fruitless efforts of the police, but he could not honestly
      say that his own efforts had been less barren. The public was talking,
      for, after all, the disappearance of poor Dimmock’s body had got noised
      abroad in an indirect sort of way, and Theodore Racksole did not like the
      idea of his impeccable hotel being the subject of sinister rumours. He
      wondered, grimly, what the public and the Sunday newspapers would say if
      they were aware of all the other phenomena, not yet common property: of
      Miss Spencer’s disappearance, of Jules’ strange visits, and of the
      non-arrival of Prince Eugen of Posen. Theodore Racksole had worried his
      brain without result. He had conducted an elaborate private investigation
      without result, and he had spent a certain amount of money without result.
      The police said that they had a clue; but Racksole remarked that it was
      always the business of the police to have a clue, that they seldom had
      more than a clue, and that a clue without some sequel to it was a pretty
      stupid business. The only sure thing in the whole affair was that a cloud
      rested over his hotel, his beautiful new toy, the finest of its kind. The
      cloud was not interfering with business, but, nevertheless, it was a
      cloud, and he fiercely resented its presence; perhaps it would be more
      correct to say that he fiercely resented his inability to dissipate it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Sampson Levi wishes to see you, sir,’ the servant repeated, having
      received no sign that his master had heard him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So I hear,’ said Racksole. ‘Does he want to see me, personally?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He asked for you, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps it is Rocco he wants to see, about a menu or something of that
      kind?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will inquire, sir,’ and the servant made a move to withdraw.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Stop,’ Racksole commanded suddenly. ‘Desire Mr Sampson Levi to step this
      way.’
    </p>
<p>
      The great stockbroker of the ‘Kaffir Circus’ entered with a simple
      unassuming air. He was a rather short, florid man, dressed like a typical
      Hebraic financier, with too much watch-chain and too little waistcoat. In
      his fat hand he held a gold-headed cane, and an absolutely new silk hat—for
      it was Friday, and Mr Levi purchased a new hat every Friday of his life,
      holiday times only excepted. He breathed heavily and sniffed through his
      nose a good deal, as though he had just performed some Herculean physical
      labour. He glanced at the American millionaire with an expression in which
      a slight embarrassment might have been detected, but at the same time his
      round, red face disclosed a certain frank admiration and good nature.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Racksole, I believe—Mr Theodore Racksole. Proud to meet you,
      sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      Such were the first words of Mr Sampson Levi. In form they were the
      greeting of a third-rate chimney-sweep, but, strangely enough, Theodore
      Racksole liked their tone. He said to himself that here, precisely where
      no one would have expected to find one, was an honest man.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good day,’ said Racksole briefly. ‘To what do I owe the pleasure—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I expect your time is limited,’ answered Sampson Levi. ‘Anyhow, mine is,
      and so I’ll come straight to the point, Mr Racksole. I’m a plain man. I
      don’t pretend to be a gentleman or any nonsense of that kind. I’m a
      stockbroker, that’s what I am, and I don’t care who knows it. The other
      night I had a ball in this hotel. It cost me a couple of thousand and odd
      pounds, and, by the way, I wrote out a cheque for your bill this morning.
      I don’t like balls, but they’re useful to me, and my little wife likes
      ‘em, and so we give ‘em. Now, I’ve nothing to say against the hotel
      management as regards that ball: it was very decently done, very decently,
      but what I want to know is this—Why did you have a private detective
      among my guests?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A private detective?’ exclaimed Racksole, somewhat surprised at this
      charge.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ Mr Sampson Levi said firmly, fanning himself in his chair, and
      gazing at Theodore Racksole with the direct earnest expression of a man
      having a grievance. ‘Yes; a private detective. It’s a small matter, I
      know, and I dare say you think you’ve got a right, as proprietor of the
      show, to do what you like in that line; but I’ve just called to tell you
      that I object. I’ve called as a matter of principle. I’m not angry; it’s
      the principle of the thing.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear Mr Levi,’ said Racksole, ‘I assure you that, having let the Gold
      Room to a private individual for a private entertainment, I should never
      dream of doing what you suggest.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Straight?’ asked Mr Sampson Levi, using his own picturesque language.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Straight,’ said Racksole smiling.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There was a gent present at my ball that I didn’t ask. I’ve got a
      wonderful memory for faces, and I know. Several fellows asked me
      afterwards what he was doing there. I was told by someone that he was one
      of your waiters, but I didn’t believe that. I know nothing of the Grand
      Babylon; it’s not quite my style of tavern, but I don’t think you’d send
      one of your own waiters to watch my guests—unless, of course, you
      sent him as a waiter; and this chap didn’t do any waiting, though he did
      his share of drinking.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps I can throw some light on this mystery,’ said Racksole. ‘I may
      tell you that I was already aware that man had attended your ball
      uninvited.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How did you get to know?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘By pure chance, Mr Levi, and not by inquiry. That man was a former waiter
      at this hotel—the head waiter, in fact—Jules. No doubt you
      have heard of him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not I,’ said Mr Levi positively.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said Racksole, ‘I was informed that everyone knew Jules, but it
      appears not. Well, be that as it may, previously to the night of your
      ball, I had dismissed Jules. I had ordered him never to enter the Babylon
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      But on that evening I encountered him here—not in the Gold Room, but
      in the hotel itself. I asked him to explain his presence, and he stated he
      was your guest. That is all I know of the matter, Mr Levi, and I am
      extremely sorry that you should have thought me capable of the enormity of
      placing a private detective among your guests.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is perfectly satisfactory to me,’ Mr Sampson Levi said, after a
      pause.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I only wanted an explanation, and I’ve got it. I was told by some pals of
      mine in the City I might rely on Mr Theodore Racksole going straight to
      the point, and I’m glad they were right. Now as to that feller Jules, I
      shall make my own inquiries as to him. Might I ask you why you dismissed
      him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know why I dismissed him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You don’t know? Oh! come now! I’m only asking because I thought you might
      be able to give me a hint why he turned up uninvited at my ball. Sorry if
      I’m too inquisitive.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all, Mr Levi; but I really don’t know. I only sort of felt that he
      was a suspicious character. I dismissed him on instinct, as it were. See?’
    </p>
<p>
      Without answering this question Mr Levi asked another. ‘If this Jules is
      such a well-known person,’ he said, ‘how could the feller hope to come to
      my ball without being recognized?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Give it up,’ said Racksole promptly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, I’ll be moving on,’ was Mr Sampson Levi’s next remark. ‘Good day,
      and thank ye. I suppose you aren’t doing anything in Kaffirs?’
    </p>
<p>
      Mr Racksole smiled a negative.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I thought not,’ said Levi. ‘Well, I never touch American rails myself, and
      so I reckon we sha’n’t come across each other. Good day.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good day,’ said Racksole politely, following Mr Sampson Levi to the door.
    </p>
<p>
      With his hand on the handle of the door, Mr Levi stopped, and, gazing at
      Theodore Racksole with a shrewd, quizzical expression, remarked:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Strange things been going on here lately, eh?’
    </p>
<p>
      The two men looked very hard at each other for several seconds.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ Racksole assented. ‘Know anything about them?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well—no, not exactly,’ said Mr Levi. ‘But I had a fancy you and I
      might be useful to each other; I had a kind of fancy to that effect.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come back and sit down again, Mr Levi,’ Racksole said, attracted by the
      evident straightforwardness of the man’s tone. ‘Now, how can we be of
      service to each other? I flatter myself I’m something of a judge of
      character, especially financial character, and I tell you—if you’ll
      put your cards on the table, I’ll do ditto with mine.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Agreed,’ said Mr Sampson Levi. ‘I’ll begin by explaining my interest in
      your hotel. I have been expecting to receive a summons from a certain
      Prince Eugen of Posen to attend him here, and that summons hasn’t arrived.
      It appears that Prince Eugen hasn’t come to London at all. Now, I could
      have taken my dying davy that he would have been here yesterday at the
      latest.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why were you so sure?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Question for question,’ said Levi. ‘Let’s clear the ground first, Mr
      Racksole. Why did you buy this hotel? That’s a conundrum that’s been
      puzzling a lot of our fellows in the City for some days past. Why did you
      buy the Grand Babylon? And what is the next move to be?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is no next move,’ answered Racksole candidly, ‘and I will tell you
      why I bought the hotel; there need be no secret about it. I bought it
      because of a whim.’ And then Theodore Racksole gave this little Jew, whom
      he had begun to respect, a faithful account of the transaction with Mr
      Felix Babylon. ‘I suppose,’ he added, ‘you find a difficulty in
      appreciating my state of mind when I did the deal.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not a bit,’ said Mr Levi. ‘I once bought an electric launch on the Thames
      in a very similar way, and it turned out to be one of the most
      satisfactory purchases I ever made. Then it’s a simple accident that you
      own this hotel at the present moment?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A simple accident—all because of a beefsteak and a bottle of Bass.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Um!’ grunted Mr Sampson Levi, stroking his triple chin.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To return to Prince Eugen,’ Racksole resumed. ‘I was expecting His
      Highness here. The State apartments had been prepared for him. He was due
      on the very afternoon that young Dimmock died. But he never came, and I
      have not heard why he has failed to arrive; nor have I seen his name in
      the papers. What his business was in London, I don’t know.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will tell you,’ said Mr Sampson Levi, ‘he was coming to arrange a
      loan.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A State loan?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No—a private loan.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Whom from?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘From me, Sampson Levi. You look surprised. If you’d lived in London a
      little longer, you’d know that I was just the person the Prince would come
      to. Perhaps you aren’t aware that down Throgmorton Street way I’m called
      “The Court Pawnbroker”, because I arrange loans for the minor,
      second-class Princes of Europe. I’m a stockbroker, but my real business is
      financing some of the little Courts of Europe. Now, I may tell you that
      the Hereditary Prince of Posen particularly wanted a million, and he
      wanted it by a certain date, and he knew that if the affair wasn’t fixed
      up by a certain time here he wouldn’t be able to get it by that certain
      date. That’s why I’m surprised he isn’t in London.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What did he need a million for?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Debts,’ answered Sampson Levi laconically.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘His own?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But he isn’t thirty years of age?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What of that? He isn’t the only European Prince who has run up a million
      of debts in a dozen years. To a Prince the thing is as easy as eating a
      sandwich.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And why has he taken this sudden resolution to liquidate them?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because the Emperor and the lady’s parents won’t let him marry till he
      has done so! And quite right, too! He’s got to show a clean sheet, or the
      Princess Anna of Eckstein-Schwartzburg will never be Princess of Posen.
      Even now the Emperor has no idea how much Prince Eugen’s debts amount to.
      If he had—!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But would not the Emperor know of this proposed loan?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not necessarily at once. It could be so managed. Twig?’ Mr Sampson Levi
      laughed. ‘I’ve carried these little affairs through before. After marriage
      it might be allowed to leak out. And you know the Princess Anna’s fortune
      is pretty big! Now, Mr Racksole,’ he added, abruptly changing his tone,
      ‘where do you suppose Prince Eugen has disappeared to? Because if he
      doesn’t turn up to-day he can’t have that million. To-day is the last day.
      To-morrow the money will be appropriated, elsewhere. Of course, I’m not
      alone in this business, and my friends have something to say.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You ask me where I think Prince Eugen has disappeared to?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you think it’s a disappearance?’
    </p>
<p>
      Sampson Levi nodded. ‘Putting two and two together,’ he said, ‘I do. The
      Dimmock business is very peculiar—very peculiar, indeed. Dimmock was
      a left-handed relation of the Posen family. Twig? Scarcely anyone knows
      that.
    </p>
<p>
      He was made secretary and companion to Prince Aribert, just to keep him in
      the domestic circle. His mother was an Irishwoman, whose misfortune was
      that she was too beautiful. Twig?’ (Mr Sampson Levi always used this
      extraordinary word when he was in a communicative mood.) ‘My belief is
      that Dimmock’s death has something to do with the disappearance of Prince
      Eugen.
    </p>
<p>
      The only thing that passes me is this: Why should anyone want to make
      Prince Eugen disappear? The poor little Prince hasn’t an enemy in the
      world. If he’s been “copped”, as they say, why has he been “copped”? It
      won’t do anyone any good.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Won’t it?’ repeated Racksole, with a sudden flash.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you mean?’ asked Mr Levi.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean this: Suppose some other European pauper Prince was anxious to
      marry Princess Anna and her fortune, wouldn’t that Prince have an interest
      in stopping this loan of yours to Prince Eugen? Wouldn’t he have an
      interest in causing Prince Eugen to disappear—at any rate, for a
      time?’
    </p>
<p>
      Sampson Levi thought hard for a few moments.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Theodore Racksole,’ he said at length, ‘I do believe you have hit on
      something.’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twelve ROCCO AND ROOM NO. 111
    </h2>
<p>
      ON the afternoon of the same day—the interview just described had
      occurred in the morning—Racksole was visited by another idea, and he
      said to himself that he ought to have thought of it before. The
      conversation with Mr Sampson Levi had continued for a considerable time,
      and the two men had exchanged various notions, and agreed to meet again,
      but the theory that Reginald Dimmock had probably been a traitor to his
      family—a traitor whose repentance had caused his death—had not
      been thoroughly discussed; the talk had tended rather to Continental
      politics, with a view to discovering what princely family might have an
      interest in the temporary disappearance of Prince Eugen. Now, as Racksole
      considered in detail the particular affair of Reginald Dimmock, deceased,
      he was struck by one point especially, to wit: Why had Dimmock and Jules
      manoeuvred to turn Nella Racksole out of Room No. 111 on that first night?
      That they had so manoeuvred, that the broken window-pane was not a mere
      accident, Racksole felt perfectly sure. He had felt perfectly sure all
      along; but the significance of the facts had not struck him. It was plain
      to him now that there must be something of extraordinary and peculiar
      importance about Room No. 111. After lunch he wandered quietly upstairs
      and looked at Room No. 111; that is to say, he looked at the outside of
      it; it happened to be occupied, but the guest was leaving that evening.
      The thought crossed his mind that there could be no object in gazing
      blankly at the outside of a room; yet he gazed; then he wandered quickly
      down again to the next floor, and in passing along the corridor of that
      floor he stopped, and with an involuntary gesture stamped his foot.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Great Scott!’ he said, ‘I’ve got hold of something—No. 111 is
      exactly over the State apartments.’
    </p>
<p>
      He went to the bureau, and issued instructions that No. 111 was not to be
      re-let to anyone until further orders. At the bureau they gave him Nella’s
      note, which ran thus:
    </p>
<p>
      Dearest Papa,—I am going away for a day or two on the trail of a
      clue.
    </p>
<p>
      If I’m not back in three days, begin to inquire for me at Ostend. Till
      then leave me alone.—Your sagacious daughter, NELL.
    </p>
<p>
      These few words, in Nella’s large scrawling hand, filled one side of the
      paper. At the bottom was a P.T.O. He turned over, and read the sentence,
      underlined, ‘P.S.—Keep an eye on Rocco.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I wonder what the little creature is up to?’ he murmured, as he tore the
      letter into small fragments, and threw them into the waste-paper basket.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, without any delay, he took the lift down to the basement, with the
      object of making a preliminary inspection of Rocco in his lair. He could
      scarcely bring himself to believe that this suave and stately gentleman,
      this enthusiast of gastronomy, was concerned in the machinations of Jules
      and other rascals unknown. Nevertheless, from habit, he obeyed his
      daughter, giving her credit for a certain amount of perspicuity and
      cleverness.
    </p>
<p>
      The kitchens of the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel are one of the wonders of Europe.
    </p>
<p>
      Only three years before the events now under narration Felix Babylon had
      had them newly installed with every device and patent that the ingenuity
      of two continents could supply. They covered nearly an acre of superficial
      space.
    </p>
<p>
      They were walled and floored from end to end with tiles and marble, which
      enabled them to be washed down every morning like the deck of a
      man-of-war.
    </p>
<p>
      Visitors were sometimes taken to see the potato-paring machine, the patent
      plate-dryer, the Babylon-spit (a contrivance of Felix Babylon’s own), the
      silver-grill, the system of connected stock-pots, and other amazing
      phenomena of the department. Sometimes, if they were fortunate, they might
      also see the artist who sculptured ice into forms of men and beasts for
      table ornaments, or the first napkin-folder in London, or the man who
      daily invented fresh designs for pastry and blancmanges. Twelve chefs
      pursued their labours in those kitchens, helped by ninety assistant chefs,
      and a further army of unconsidered menials. Over all these was Rocco,
      supreme and unapproachable. Half-way along the suite of kitchens, Rocco
      had an apartment of his own, wherein he thought out those magnificent
      combinations, those marvellous feats of succulence and originality, which
      had given him his fame. Visitors never caught a glimpse of Rocco in the
      kitchens, though sometimes, on a special night, he would stroll
      nonchalantly through the dining-room, like the great man he was, to
      receive the compliments of the hotel habitués—people of insight who
      recognized his uniqueness.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole’s sudden and unusual appearance in the kitchen caused a
      little stir. He nodded to some of the chefs, but said nothing to anyone,
      merely wandering about amid the maze of copper utensils, and white-capped
      workers. At length he saw Rocco, surrounded by several admiring chefs.
      Rocco was bending over a freshly-roasted partridge which lay on a blue
      dish. He plunged a long fork into the back of the bird, and raised it in
      the air with his left hand. In his right he held a long glittering
      carving-knife. He was giving one of his world-famous exhibitions of
      carving. In four swift, unerring, delicate, perfect strokes he cleanly
      severed the limbs of the partridge. It was a wonderful achievement—how
      wondrous none but the really skilful carver can properly appreciate. The
      chefs emitted a hum of applause, and Rocco, long, lean, and graceful,
      retired to his own apartment. Racksole followed him. Rocco sat in a chair,
      one hand over his eyes; he had not noticed Theodore Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What are you doing, M. Rocco?’ the millionaire asked smiling. ‘Ah!’
      exclaimed Rocco, starting up with an apology. ‘Pardon! I was inventing a
      new mayonnaise, which I shall need for a certain menu next week.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you invent these things without materials, then?’ questioned Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly. I do dem in my mind. I tink dem. Why should I want materials?
      I know all flavours. I tink, and tink, and tink, and it is done. I write
      down.
    </p>
<p>
      I give the recipe to my best chef—dere you are. I need not even
      taste, I know how it will taste. It is like composing music. De great
      composers do not compose at de piano.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I see,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is because I work like dat dat you pay me three thousand a year,’
      Rocco added gravely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Heard about Jules?’ said Racksole abruptly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Jules?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes. He’s been arrested in Ostend,’ the millionaire continued, lying
      cleverly at a venture. ‘They say that he and several others are implicated
      in a murder case—the murder of Reginald Dimmock.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Truly?’ drawled Rocco, scarcely hiding a yawn. His indifference was so
      superb, so gorgeous, that Racksole instantly divined that it was assumed
      for the occasion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It seems that, after all, the police are good for something. But this is
      the first time I ever knew them to be worth their salt. There is to be a
      thorough and systematic search of the hotel to-morrow,’ Racksole went on.
      ‘I have mentioned it to you to warn you that so far as you are concerned
      the search is of course merely a matter of form. You will not object to
      the detectives looking through your rooms?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly not,’ and Rocco shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall ask you to say nothing about this to anyone,’ said Racksole. ‘The
      news of Jules’ arrest is quite private to myself. The papers know nothing
      of it. You comprehend?’
    </p>
<p>
      Rocco smiled in his grand manner, and Rocco’s master thereupon went away.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole was very well satisfied with the little conversation. It was
      perhaps dangerous to tell a series of mere lies to a clever fellow like
      Rocco, and Racksole wondered how he should ultimately explain them to this
      great master-chef if his and Nella’s suspicions should be unfounded, and
      nothing came of them. Nevertheless, Rocco’s manner, a strange elusive
      something in the man’s eyes, had nearly convinced Racksole that he was
      somehow implicated in Jules’ schemes—and probably in the death of
      Reginald Dimmock and the disappearance of Prince Eugen of Posen.
    </p>
<p>
      That night, or rather about half-past one the next morning, when the last
      noises of the hotel’s life had died down, Racksole made his way to Room
      111 on the second floor. He locked the door on the inside, and proceeded
      to examine the place, square foot by square foot. Every now and then some
      creak or other sound startled him, and he listened intently for a few
      seconds. The bedroom was furnished in the ordinary splendid style of
      bedrooms at the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel, and in that respect called for no
      remark. What most interested Racksole was the flooring. He pulled up the
      thick Oriental carpet, and peered along every plank, but could discover
      nothing unusual.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he went to the dressing-room, and finally to the bathroom, both of
      which opened out of the main room. But in neither of these smaller
      chambers was he any more successful than in the bedroom itself. Finally he
      came to the bath, which was enclosed in a panelled casing of polished
      wood, after the manner of baths. Some baths have a cupboard beneath the
      taps, with a door at the side, but this one appeared to have none. He
      tapped the panels, but not a single one of them gave forth that ‘curious
      hollow sound’ which usually betokens a secret place. Idly he turned the
      cold-tap of the bath, and the water began to rush in. He turned off the
      cold-tap and turned on the waste-tap, and as he did so his knee, which was
      pressing against the panelling, slipped forward. The panelling had given
      way, and he saw that one large panel was hinged from the inside, and
      caught with a hasp, also on the inside. A large space within the casing of
      the end of the bath was thus revealed. Before doing anything else,
      Racksole tried to repeat the trick with the waste-tap, but he failed; it
      would not work again, nor could he in any way perceive that there was any
      connection between the rod of the waste-tap and the hasp of the panel.
      Racksole could not see into the cavity within the casing, and the electric
      light was fixed, and could not be moved about like a candle. He felt in
      his pockets, and fortunately discovered a box of matches. Aided by these,
      he looked into the cavity, and saw nothing; nothing except a rather large
      hole at the far end—some three feet from the casing. With some
      difficulty he squeezed himself through the open panel, and took a
      half-kneeling, half-sitting posture within. There he struck a match, and
      it was a most unfortunate thing that in striking, the box being half open,
      he set fire to all the matches, and was half smothered in the atrocious
      stink of phosphorus which resulted. One match burned clear on the floor of
      the cavity, and, rubbing his eyes, Racksole picked it up, and looked down
      the hole which he had previously descried. It was a hole apparently
      bottomless, and about eighteen inches square. The curious part about the
      hole was that a rope-ladder hung down it. When he saw that rope-ladder
      Racksole smiled the smile of a happy man.
    </p>
<p>
      The match went out.
    </p>
<p>
      Should he make a long journey, perhaps to some distant corner of the
      hotel, for a fresh box of matches, or should he attempt to descend that
      rope-ladder in the dark? He decided on the latter course, and he was the
      more strongly moved thereto as he could now distinguish a faint, a very
      faint tinge of light at the bottom of the hole.
    </p>
<p>
      With infinite care he compressed himself into the well-like hole, and
      descended the latter. At length he arrived on firm ground, perspiring, but
      quite safe and quite excited. He saw now that the tinge of light came
      through a small hole in the wood. He put his eye to the wood, and found
      that he had a fine view of the State bathroom, and through the door of the
      State bathroom into the State bedroom. At the massive marble-topped
      washstand in the State bedroom a man was visible, bending over some object
      which lay thereon.
    </p>
<p>
      The man was Rocco!
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Thirteen IN THE STATE BEDROOM
    </h2>
<p>
      IT was of course plain to Racksole that the peculiar passageway which he
      had, at great personal inconvenience, discovered between the bathroom of
      No. 111 and the State bathroom on the floor below must have been specially
      designed by some person or persons for the purpose of keeping a nefarious
      watch upon the occupants of the State suite of apartments. It was a means
      of communication at once simple and ingenious. At that moment he could not
      be sure of the precise method employed for it, but he surmised that the
      casing of the waterpipes had been used as a ‘well’, while space for the
      pipes themselves had been found in the thickness of the ample brick walls
      of the Grand Babylon. The eye-hole, through which he now had a view of the
      bedroom, was a very minute one, and probably would scarcely be noticed
      from the exterior. One thing he observed concerning it, namely, that it
      had been made for a man somewhat taller than himself; he was obliged to
      stand on tiptoe in order to get his eye in the correct position. He
      remembered that both Jules and Rocco were distinctly above the average
      height; also that they were both thin men, and could have descended the
      well with comparative ease. Theodore Racksole, though not stout, was a
      well-set man with large bones.
    </p>
<p>
      These things flashed through his mind as he gazed, spellbound, at the
      mysterious movements of Rocco. The door between the bathroom and the
      bedroom was wide open, and his own situation was such that his view
      embraced a considerable portion of the bedroom, including the whole of the
      immense and gorgeously-upholstered bedstead, but not including the whole
      of the marble washstand. He could see only half of the washstand, and at
      intervals Rocco passed out of sight as his lithe hands moved over the
      object which lay on the marble. At first Theodore Racksole could not
      decide what this object was, but after a time, as his eyes grew accustomed
      to the position and the light, he made it out.
    </p>
<p>
      It was the body of a man. Or, rather, to be more exact, Racksole could
      discern the legs of a man on that half of the table which was visible to
      him. Involuntarily he shuddered, as the conviction forced itself upon him
      that Rocco had some unconscious human being helpless on that cold marble
      surface. The legs never moved. Therefore, the hapless creature was either
      asleep or under the influence of an anaesthetic—or (horrible
      thought!) dead.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole wanted to call out, to stop by some means or other the dreadful
      midnight activity which was proceeding before his astonished eyes; but
      fortunately he restrained himself.
    </p>
<p>
      On the washstand he could see certain strangely-shaped utensils and
      instruments which Rocco used from time to time. The work seemed to
      Racksole to continue for interminable hours, and then at last Rocco
      ceased, gave a sign of satisfaction, whistled several bars from
      ‘Cavalleria Rusticana’, and came into the bath-room, where he took off his
      coat, and very quietly washed his hands. As he stood calmly and leisurely
      wiping those long fingers of his, he was less than four feet from
      Racksole, and the cooped-up millionaire trembled, holding his breath, lest
      Rocco should detect his presence behind the woodwork. But nothing
      happened, and Rocco returned unsuspectingly to the bedroom. Racksole saw
      him place some sort of white flannel garment over the prone form on the
      table, and then lift it bodily on to the great bed, where it lay awfully
      still. The hidden watcher was sure now that it was a corpse upon which
      Rocco had been exercising his mysterious and sinister functions.
    </p>
<p>
      But whose corpse? And what functions? Could this be a West End hotel,
      Racksole’s own hotel, in the very heart of London, the best-policed city
      in the world? It seemed incredible, impossible; yet so it was. Once more
      he remembered what Felix Babylon had said to him and realized the truth of
      the saying anew. The proprietor of a vast and complicated establishment
      like the Grand Babylon could never know a tithe of the extraordinary and
      queer occurrences which happened daily under his very nose; the atmosphere
      of such a caravanserai must necessarily be an atmosphere of mystery and
      problems apparently inexplicable. Nevertheless, Racksole thought that Fate
      was carrying things with rather a high hand when she permitted his chef to
      spend the night hours over a man’s corpse in his State bedroom, this
      sacred apartment which was supposed to be occupied only by individuals of
      Royal Blood. Racksole would not have objected to a certain amount of
      mystery, but he decidedly thought that there was a little too much mystery
      here for his taste. He thought that even Felix Babylon would have been
      surprised at this.
    </p>
<p>
      The electric chandelier in the centre of the ceiling was not lighted; only
      the two lights on either side of the washstand were switched on, and these
      did not sufficiently illuminate the features of the man on the bed to
      enable Racksole to see them clearly. In vain the millionaire strained his
      eyes; he could only make out that the corpse was probably that of a young
      man. Just as he was wondering what would be the best course of action to
      pursue, he saw Rocco with a square-shaped black box in his hand. Then the
      chef switched off the two electric lights, and the State bedroom was in
      darkness. In that swift darkness Racksole heard Rocco spring on to the
      bed. Another half-dozen moments of suspense, and there was a blinding
      flash of white, which endured for several seconds, and showed Rocco
      standing like an evil spirit over the corpse, the black box in one hand
      and a burning piece of aluminium wire in the other. The aluminium wire
      burnt out, and darkness followed blacker than before.
    </p>
<p>
      Rocco had photographed the corpse by flashlight.
    </p>
<p>
      But the dazzling flare which had disclosed the features of the dead man to
      the insensible lens of the camera had disclosed them also to Theodore
      Racksole. The dead man was Reginald Dimmock!
    </p>
<p>
      Stung into action by this discovery, Racksole tried to find the exit from
      his place of concealment. He felt sure that there existed some way out
      into the State bathroom, but he sought for it fruitlessly, groping with
      both hands and feet. Then he decided that he must ascend the rope-ladder,
      make haste for the first-floor corridor, and intercept Rocco when he left
      the State apartments. It was a painful and difficult business to ascend
      that thin and yielding ladder in such a confined space, but Racksole was
      managing it very nicely, and had nearly reached the top, when, by some
      untoward freak of chance, the ladder broke above his weight, and he
      slipped ignominiously down to the bottom of the wooden tube. Smothering an
      excusable curse, Racksole crouched, baffled. Then he saw that the force of
      his fall had somehow opened a trap-door at his feet. He squeezed through,
      pushed open another tiny door, and in another second stood in the State
      bathroom. He was dishevelled, perspiring, rather bewildered; but he was
      there. In the next second he had resumed absolute command of all his
      faculties.
    </p>
<p>
      Strange to say, he had moved so quietly that Rocco had apparently not
      heard him. He stepped noiselessly to the door between the bathroom and the
      bedroom, and stood there in silence. Rocco had switched on again the
      lights over the washstand and was busy with his utensils.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole deliberately coughed.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Fourteen ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS
    </h2>
<p>
      ROCCO turned round with the swiftness of a startled tiger, and gave
      Theodore Racksole one long piercing glance.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘D—n!’ said Rocco, with as pure an Anglo-Saxon accent and intonation
      as Racksole himself could have accomplished.
    </p>
<p>
      The most extraordinary thing about the situation was that at this juncture
      Theodore Racksole did not know what to say. He was so dumbfounded by the
      affair, and especially by Rocco’s absolute and sublime calm, that both
      speech and thought failed him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I give in,’ said Rocco. ‘From the moment you entered this cursed hotel I
      was afraid of you. I told Jules I was afraid of you. I knew there would be
      trouble with a man of your kidney, and I was right; confound it! I tell
      you I give in. I know when I’m beaten. I’ve got no revolver and no weapons
      of any kind. I surrender. Do what you like.’
    </p>
<p>
      And with that Rocco sat down on a chair. It was magnificently done. Only a
      truly great man could have done it. Rocco actually kept his dignity.
    </p>
<p>
      For answer, Racksole walked slowly into the vast apartment, seized a
      chair, and, dragging it up to Rocco’s chair, sat down opposite to him.
      Thus they faced each other, their knees almost touching, both in evening
      dress. On Rocco’s right hand was the bed, with the corpse of Reginald
      Dimmock. On Racksole’s right hand, and a little behind him, was the marble
      washstand, still littered with Rocco’s implements. The electric light
      shone on Rocco’s left cheek, leaving the other side of his face in shadow.
      Racksole tapped him on the knee twice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So you’re another Englishman masquerading as a foreigner in my hotel,’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole remarked, by way of commencing the interrogation.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m not,’ answered Rocco quietly. ‘I’m a citizen of the United States.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The deuce you are!’ Racksole exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, I was born at West Orange, New Jersey, New York State. I call myself
      an Italian because it was in Italy that I first made a name as a chef—at
      Rome. It is better for a great chef like me to be a foreigner. Imagine a
      great chef named Elihu P. Rucker. You can’t imagine it. I changed my
      nationality for the same reason that my friend and colleague, Jules,
      otherwise Mr Jackson, changed his.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So Jules is your friend and colleague, is he?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He was, but from this moment he is no longer. I began to disapprove of
      his methods no less than a week ago, and my disapproval will now take
      active form.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Will it?’ said Racksole. ‘I calculate it just won’t, Mr Elihu P. Rucker,
      citizen of the United States. Before you are very much older you’ll be in
      the kind hands of the police, and your activities, in no matter what
      direction, will come to an abrupt conclusion.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is possible,’ sighed Rocco.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In the meantime, I’ll ask you one or two questions for my own private
      satisfaction. You’ve acknowledged that the game is up, and you may as well
      answer them with as much candour as you feel yourself capable of. See?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I see,’ replied Rocco calmly, ‘but I guess I can’t answer all questions.
    </p>
<p>
      I’ll do what I can.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said Racksole, clearing his throat, ‘what’s the scheme all about?
      Tell me in a word.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not in a thousand words. It isn’t my secret, you know.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why was poor little Dimmock poisoned?’ The millionaire’s voice softened
      as he looked for an instant at the corpse of the unfortunate young man.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know,’ said Rocco. ‘I don’t mind informing you that I objected to
      that part of the business. I wasn’t made aware of it till after it was
      done, and then I tell you it got my dander up considerable.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You mean to say you don’t know why Dimmock was done to death?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean to say I couldn’t see the sense of it. Of course he—er—died,
      because he sort of cried off the scheme, having previously taken a share
      of it. I don’t mind saying that much, because you probably guessed it for
      yourself. But I solemnly state that I have a conscientious objection to
      murder.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then it was murder?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It was a kind of murder,’ Rocco admitted. ‘Who did it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Unfair question,’ said Rocco.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who else is in this precious scheme besides Jules and yourself?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t know, on my honour.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, then, tell me this. What have you been doing to Dimmock’s body?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How long were you in that bathroom?’ Rocco parried with sublime
      impudence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t question me, Mr Rucker,’ said Theodore Racksole. ‘I feel very much
      inclined to break your back across my knee. Therefore I advise you not to
      irritate me. What have you been doing to Dimmock’s body?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ve been embalming it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Em—balming it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly; Richardson’s system of arterial fluid injection, as improved
      by myself. You weren’t aware that I included the art of embalming among my
      accomplishments. Nevertheless, it is so.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But why?’ asked Racksole, more mystified than ever. ‘Why should you
      trouble to embalm the poor chap’s corpse?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Can’t you see? Doesn’t it strike you? That corpse has to be taken care
      of.
    </p>
<p>
      It contains, or rather, it did contain, very serious evidence against some
      person or persons unknown to the police. It may be necessary to move it
      about from place to place. A corpse can’t be hidden for long; a corpse
      betrays itself. One couldn’t throw it in the Thames, for it would have
      been found inside twelve hours. One couldn’t bury it—it wasn’t safe.
      The only thing was to keep it handy and movable, ready for emergencies. I
      needn’t inform you that, without embalming, you can’t keep a corpse handy
      and movable for more than four or five days. It’s the kind of thing that
      won’t keep. And so it was suggested that I should embalm it, and I did.
      Mind you, I still objected to the murder, but I couldn’t go back on a
      colleague, you understand. You do understand that, don’t you? Well, here
      you are, and here it is, and that’s all.’
    </p>
<p>
      Rocco leaned back in his chair as though he had said everything that ought
      to be said. He closed his eyes to indicate that so far as he was concerned
      the conversation was also closed. Theodore Racksole stood up.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I hope,’ said Rocco, suddenly opening his eyes, ‘I hope you’ll call in
      the police without any delay. It’s getting late, and I don’t like going
      without my night’s rest.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where do you suppose you’ll get a night’s rest?’ Racksole asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In the cells, of course. Haven’t I told you I know when I’m beaten. I’m
      not so blind as not to be able to see that there’s at any rate a prima
      facie case against me. I expect I shall get off with a year or two’s
      imprisonment as accessory after the fact—I think that’s what they
      call it. Anyhow, I shall be in a position to prove that I am not
      implicated in the murder of this unfortunate nincompoop.’ He pointed, with
      a strange, scornful gesture of his elbow, to the bed. ‘And now, shall we
      go? Everyone is asleep, but there will be a policeman within call of the
      watchman in the portico. I am at your service. Let us go down together, Mr
      Racksole. I give you my word to go quietly.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Stay a moment,’ said Theodore Racksole curtly; ‘there is no hurry. It
      won’t do you any harm to forego another hour’s sleep, especially as you
      will have no work to do to-morrow. I have one or two more questions to put
      to you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well?’ Rocco murmured, with an air of tired resignation, as if to say,
      ‘What must be must be.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where has Dimmock’s corpse been during the last three or four days, since
      he—died?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh!’ answered Rocco, apparently surprised at the simplicity of the
      question. ‘It’s been in my room, and one night it was on the roof; once it
      went out of the hotel as luggage, but it came back the next day as a case
      of Demerara sugar. I forget where else it has been, but it’s been kept
      perfectly safe and treated with every consideration.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And who contrived all these manoeuvres?’ asked Racksole as calmly as he
      could.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I did. That is to say, I invented them and I saw that they were carried
      out. You see, the suspicions of your police obliged me to be particularly
      spry.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And who carried them out?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! that would be telling tales. But I don’t mind assuring you that my
      accomplices were innocent accomplices. It is absurdly easy for a man like
      me to impose on underlings—absurdly easy.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What did you intend to do with the corpse ultimately?’ Racksole pursued
      his inquiry with immovable countenance.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who knows?’ said Rocco, twisting his beautiful moustache. ‘That would
      have depended on several things—on your police, for instance. But
      probably in the end we should have restored this mortal clay’—again
      he jerked his elbow—‘to the man’s sorrowing relatives.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you know who the relatives are?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly. Don’t you? If you don’t I need only hint that Dimmock had a
      Prince for his father.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It seems to me,’ said Racksole, with cold sarcasm, ‘that you behaved
      rather clumsily in choosing this bedroom as the scene of your operations.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all,’ said Rocco. ‘There was no other apartment so suitable in the
      whole hotel. Who would have guessed that anything was going on here? It
      was the very place for me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I guessed,’ said Racksole succinctly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, you guessed, Mr Racksole. But I had not counted on you. You are the
      only smart man in the business. You are an American citizen, and I hadn’t
      reckoned to have to deal with that class of person.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Apparently I frightened you this afternoon?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not in the least.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You were not afraid of a search?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I knew that no search was intended. I knew that you were trying to
      frighten me. You must really credit me with a little sagacity and insight,
      Mr Racksole. Immediately you began to talk to me in the kitchen this
      afternoon I felt you were on the track. But I was not frightened. I merely
      decided that there was no time to be lost—that I must act quickly. I
      did act quickly, but, it seems, not quickly enough. I grant that your
      rapidity exceeded mine. Let us go downstairs, I beg.’
    </p>
<p>
      Rocco rose and moved towards the door. With an instinctive action Racksole
      rushed forward and seized him by the shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No tricks!’ said Racksole. ‘You’re in my custody and don’t forget it.’
    </p>
<p>
      Rocco turned on his employer a look of gentle, dignified scorn. ‘Have I
      not informed you,’ he said, ‘that I have the intention of going quietly?’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole felt almost ashamed for the moment. It flashed across him that a
      man can be great, even in crime.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What an ineffable fool you were,’ said Racksole, stopping him at the
      threshold, ‘with your talents, your unique talents, to get yourself mixed
      up in an affair of this kind. You are ruined. And, by Jove! you were a
      great man in your own line.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Racksole,’ said Rocco very quickly, ‘that is the truest word you have
      spoken this night. I was a great man in my own line. And I am an ineffable
      fool. Alas!’ He brought his long arms to his sides with a thud.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you do it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I was fascinated—fascinated by Jules. He, too, is a great man. We
      had great opportunities, here in the Grand Babylon. It was a great game.
      It was worth the candle. The prizes were enormous. You would admit these
      things if you knew the facts. Perhaps some day you will know them, for you
      are a fairly clever person at getting to the root of a matter. Yes, I was
      blinded, hypnotized.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now you are ruined.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not ruined, not ruined. Afterwards, in a few years, I shall come up
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      A man of genius like me is never ruined till he is dead. Genius is always
      forgiven. I shall be forgiven. Suppose I am sent to prison. When I emerge
      I shall be no gaol-bird. I shall be Rocco—the great Rocco. And half
      the hotels in Europe will invite me to join them.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let me tell you, as man to man, that you have achieved your own
      degradation. There is no excuse.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I know it,’ said Rocco. ‘Let us go.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole was distinctly and notably impressed by this man—by this
      master spirit to whom he was to have paid a salary at the rate of three
      thousand pounds a year. He even felt sorry for him. And so, side by side,
      the captor and the captured, they passed into the vast deserted corridor
      of the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
      Rocco stopped at the grating of the first lift.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It will be locked,’ said Racksole. ‘We must use the stairs to-night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But I have a key. I always carry one,’ said Rocco, and he pulled one out
      of his pocket, and, unfastening the iron screen, pushed it open. Racksole
      smiled at his readiness and aplomb.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘After you,’ said Rocco, bowing in his finest manner, and Racksole stepped
      into the lift.
    </p>
<p>
      With the swiftness of lighting Rocco pushed forward the iron screen, which
      locked itself automatically. Theodore Racksole was hopelessly a prisoner
      within the lift, while Rocco stood free in the corridor.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good-bye, Mr Racksole,’ he remarked suavely, bowing again, lower than
      before. ‘Good-bye: I hate to take a mean advantage of you in this fashion,
      but really you must allow that you have been very simple. You are a clever
      man, as I have already said, up to a certain point. It is past that point
      that my own cleverness comes in. Again, good-bye. After all, I shall have
      no rest to-night, but perhaps even that will be better that sleeping in a
      police cell. If you make a great noise you may wake someone and ultimately
      get released from this lift. But I advise you to compose yourself, and
      wait till morning. It will be more dignified. For the third time,
      good-bye.’
    </p>
<p>
      And with that Rocco, without hastening, walked down the corridor and so
      out of sight.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole said never a word. He was too disgusted with himself to speak. He
      clenched his fists, and put his teeth together, and held his breath. In
      the silence he could hear the dwindling sound of Rocco’s footsteps on the
      thick carpet.
    </p>
<p>
      It was the greatest blow of Racksole’s life.
    </p>
<p>
      The next morning the high-born guests of the Grand Babylon were aroused by
      a rumour that by some accident the millionaire proprietor of the hotel had
      remained all night locked up in the lift. It was also stated that Rocco had
      quarrelled with his new master and incontinently left the place. A duchess
      said that Rocco’s departure would mean the ruin of the hotel, whereupon
      her husband advised her not to talk nonsense.
    </p>
<p>
      As for Racksole, he sent a message for the detective in charge of the
      Dimmock affair, and bravely told him the happenings of the previous night.
    </p>
<p>
      The narration was a decided ordeal to a man of Racksole’s temperament.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A strange story!’ commented Detective Marshall, and he could not avoid a
      smile. ‘The climax was unfortunate, but you have certainly got some
      valuable facts.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole said nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I myself have a clue,’ added the detective. ‘When your message arrived I
      was just coming up to see you. I want you to accompany me to a certain
      spot not far from here. Will you come, now, at once?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With pleasure,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      At that moment a page entered with a telegram. Racksole opened it read:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Please come instantly. Nella. HÃ´tel Wellington, Ostend.’
    </p>
<p>
      He looked at his watch.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I can’t come,’ he said to the detective. I’m going to Ostend.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To Ostend?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, now.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But really, Mr Racksole,’ protested the detective. ‘My business is
      urgent.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So’s mine,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      In ten minutes he was on his way to Victoria Station.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Fifteen END OF THE YACHT ADVENTURE
    </h2>
<p>
      WE must now return to Nella Racksole and Prince Aribert of Posen on board
      the yacht without a name. The Prince’s first business was to make Jules,
      otherwise Mr Tom Jackson, perfectly secure by means of several pieces of
      rope. Although Mr Jackson had been stunned into a complete
      unconsciousness, and there was a contused wound under his ear, no one
      could say how soon he might not come to himself and get very violent. So
      the Prince, having tied his arms and legs, made him fast to a stanchion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I hope he won’t die,’ said Nella. ‘He looks very white.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Mr Jacksons of this world,’ said Prince Aribert sententiously, ‘never
      die till they are hung. By the way, I wonder how it is that no one has
      interfered with us. Perhaps they are discreetly afraid of my revolver—of
      your revolver, I mean.’
    </p>
<p>
      Both he and Nella glanced up at the imperturbable steersman, who kept the
      yacht’s head straight out to sea. By this time they were about a couple of
      miles from the Belgian shore.
    </p>
<p>
      Addressing him in French, the Prince ordered the sailor to put the yacht
      about, and make again for Ostend Harbour, but the fellow took no notice
      whatever of the summons. The Prince raised the revolver, with the idea of
      frightening the steersman, and then the man began to talk rapidly in a
      mixture of French and Flemish. He said that he had received Jules’ strict
      orders not to interfere in any way, no matter what might happen on the
      deck of the yacht. He was the captain of the yacht, and he had to make for
      a certain English port, the name of which he could not divulge: he was to
      keep the vessel at full steam ahead under any and all circumstances. He
      seemed to be a very big, a very strong, and a very determined man, and the
      Prince was at a loss what course of action to pursue. He asked several
      more questions, but the only effect of them was to render the man taciturn
      and ill-humoured.
    </p>
<p>
      In vain Prince Aribert explained that Miss Nella Racksole, daughter of
      millionaire Racksole, had been abducted by Mr Tom Jackson; in vain he
      flourished the revolver threateningly; the surly but courageous captain
      said merely that that had nothing to do with him; he had instructions, and
      he should carry them out. He sarcastically begged to remind his
      interlocutor that he was the captain of the yacht.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It won’t do to shoot him, I suppose,’ said the Prince to Nella. ‘I might
      bore a hole into his leg, or something of that kind.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s rather risky, and rather hard on the poor captain, with his
      extraordinary sense of duty,’ said Nella. ‘And, besides, the whole crew
      might turn on us. No, we must think of something else.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I wonder where the crew is,’ said the Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      Just then Mr Jackson, prone and bound on the deck, showed signs of
      recovering from his swoon. His eyes opened, and he gazed vacantly around.
      At length he caught sight of the Prince, who approached him with the
      revolver well in view.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s you, is it?’ he murmured faintly. ‘What are you doing on board?
      Who’s tied me up like this?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘See here!’ replied the Prince, ‘I don’t want to have any arguments, but
      this yacht must return to Ostend at once, where you will be given up to
      the authorities.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Really!’ snarled Mr Tom Jackson. ‘Shall I!’ Then he called out in French
      to the man at the wheel, ‘Hi André! let these two be put off in the
      dinghy.’
    </p>
<p>
      It was a peculiar situation. Certain of nothing but the possession of
      Nella’s revolver, the Prince scarcely knew whether to carry the argument
      further, and with stronger measures, or to accept the situation with as
      much dignity as the circumstances would permit.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let us take the dinghy,’ said Nella; ‘we can row ashore in an hour.’
    </p>
<p>
      He felt that she was right. To leave the yacht in such a manner seemed
      somewhat ignominious, and it certainly involved the escape of that
      profound villain, Mr Thomas Jackson. But what else could be done? The
      Prince and Nella constituted one party on the vessel; they knew their own
      strength, but they did not know the strength of their opponents. They held
      the hostile ringleader bound and captive, but this man had proved himself
      capable of giving orders, and even to gag him would not help them if the
      captain of the yacht persisted in his obstinate course. Moreover, there
      was a distinct objection to promiscuous shooting. The Prince felt that
      there was no knowing how promiscuous shooting might end.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We will take the dinghy,’ said the Prince quickly, to the captain.
    </p>
<p>
      A bell rang below, and a sailor and the Negro boy appeared on deck. The
      pulsations of the screw grew less rapid. The yacht stopped. The dinghy was
      lowered. As the Prince and Nella prepared to descend into the little
      cock-boat Mr Tom Jackson addressed Nella, all bound as he lay.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good-bye,’ he said, ‘I shall see you again, never fear.’.
    </p>
<p>
      In another moment they were in the dinghy, and the dinghy was adrift. The
      yacht’s screw churned the water, and the beautiful vessel slipped away from
      them. As it receded a figure appeared at the stem. It was Mr Thomas
      Jackson.
    </p>
<p>
      He had been released by his minions. He held a white handkerchief to his
      ear, and offered a calm, enigmatic smile to the two forlorn but victorious
      occupants of the dinghy. Jules had been defeated for once in his life; or
      perhaps it would be more just to say that he had been out-manoeuvred. Men
      like Jules are incapable of being defeated. It was characteristic of his
      luck that now, in the very hour when he had been caught red-handed in a
      serious crime against society, he should be effecting a leisurely escape—an
      escape which left no clue behind.
    </p>
<p>
      The sea was utterly calm and blue in the morning sun. The dinghy rocked
      itself lazily in the swell of the yacht’s departure. As the mist cleared
      away the outline of the shore became more distinct, and it appeared as if
      Ostend was distant scarcely a cable’s length. The white dome of the great
      Kursaal glittered in the pale turquoise sky, and the smoke of steamers in
      the harbour could be plainly distinguished. On the offing was a crowd of
      brown-sailed fishing luggers returning with the night’s catch. The
      many-hued bathing-vans could be counted on the distant beach. Everything
      seemed perfectly normal. It was difficult for either Nella or her
      companion to realize that anything extraordinary had happened within the
      last hour. Yet there was the yacht, not a mile off, to prove to them that
      something very extraordinary had, in fact, happened. The yacht was no
      vision, nor was that sinister watching figure at its stern a vision,
      either.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose Jules was too surprised and too feeble to inquire how I came to
      be on board his yacht,’ said the Prince, taking the oars.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! How did you?’ asked Nella, her face lighting up. ‘Really, I had
      almost forgotten that part of the affair.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I must begin at the beginning and it will take some time,’ answered the
      Prince. ‘Had we not better postpone the recital till we get ashore?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will row and you shall talk,’ said Nella. ‘I want to know now.’
    </p>
<p>
      He smiled happily at her, but gently declined to yield up the oars.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is it not sufficient that I am here?’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is sufficient, yes,’ she replied, ‘but I want to know.’
    </p>
<p>
      With a long, easy stroke he was pulling the dinghy shorewards. She sat in
      the stern-sheets.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is no rudder,’ he remarked, ‘so you must direct me. Keep the boat’s
      head on the lighthouse. The tide seems to be running in strongly; that
      will help us. The people on shore will think that we have only been for a
      little early morning excursion.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Will you kindly tell me how it came about that you were able to save my
      life, Prince?’ she said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Save your life, Miss Racksole? I didn’t save your life; I merely knocked
      a man down.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You saved my life,’ she repeated. ‘That villain would have stopped at
      nothing. I saw it in his eye.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you were a brave woman, for you showed no fear of death.’ His
      admiring gaze rested full on her. For a moment the oars ceased to move.
    </p>
<p>
      She gave a gesture of impatience.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It happened that I saw you last night in your carriage,’ he said. ‘The
      fact is, I had not had the audacity to go to Berlin with my story. I
      stopped in Ostend to see whether I could do a little detective work on my
      own account.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a piece of good luck that I saw you. I followed the carriage as
      quickly as I could, and I just caught a glimpse of you as you entered that
      awful house. I knew that Jules had something to do with that house. I
      guessed what you were doing. I was afraid for you. Fortunately I had
      surveyed the house pretty thoroughly. There is an entrance to it at the
      back, from a narrow lane. I made my way there. I got into the yard at the
      back, and I stood under the window of the room where you had the interview
      with Miss Spencer. I heard everything that was said. It was a courageous
      enterprise on your part to follow Miss Spencer from the Grand Babylon to
      Ostend. Well, I dared not force an entrance, lest I might precipitate
      matters too suddenly, and involve both of us in a difficulty. I merely
      kept watch. Ah, Miss Racksole! you were magnificent with Miss Spencer; as
      I say, I could hear every word, for the window was slightly open. I felt
      that you needed no assistance from me. And then she cheated you with a
      trick, and the revolver came flying through the window. I picked it up, I
      thought it would probably be useful. There was a silence. I did not guess
      at first that you had fainted. I thought that you had escaped. When I
      found out the truth it was too late for me to intervene. There were two
      men, both desperate, besides Miss Spencer—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who was the other man?’ asked Nella.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not know. It was dark. They drove away with you to the harbour.
      Again I followed. I saw them carry you on board. Before the yacht weighed
      anchor I managed to climb unobserved into the dinghy. I lay down full
      length in it, and no one suspected that I was there. I think you know the
      rest.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Was the yacht all ready for sea?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The yacht was all ready for sea. The captain fellow was on the bridge,
      and steam was up.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then they expected me! How could that be?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They expected some one. I do not think they expected you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Did the second man go on board?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He helped to carry you along the gangway, but he came back again to the
      carriage. He was the driver.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And no one else saw the business?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The quay was deserted. You see, the last steamer had arrived for the
      night.’
    </p>
<p>
      There was a brief silence, and then Nella ejaculated, under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Truly, it is a wonderful world!’
    </p>
<p>
      And it was a wonderful world for them, though scarcely perhaps, in the
      sense which Nella Racksole had intended. They had just emerged from a
      highly disconcerting experience. Among other minor inconveniences, they
      had had no breakfast. They were out in the sea in a tiny boat. Neither of
      them knew what the day might bring forth. The man, at least, had the most
      serious anxieties for the safety of his Royal nephew. And yet—and
      yet—neither of them wished that that voyage of the little boat on
      the summer tide should come to an end. Each, perhaps unconsciously, had a
      vague desire that it might last for ever, he lazily pulling, she directing
      his course at intervals by a movement of her distractingly pretty head.
      How was this condition of affairs to be explained? Well, they were both
      young; they both had superb health, and all the ardour of youth; and—they
      were together.
    </p>
<p>
      The boat was very small indeed; her face was scarcely a yard from his.
      She, in his eyes, surrounded by the glamour of beauty and vast wealth; he,
      in her eyes, surrounded by the glamour of masculine intrepidity and the
      brilliance of a throne.
    </p>
<p>
      But all voyages come to an end, either at the shore or at the bottom of
      the sea, and at length the dinghy passed between the stone jetties of the
      harbour. The Prince rowed to the nearest steps, tied up the boat, and they
      landed. It was six o’clock in the morning, and a day of gorgeous sunlight
      had opened. Few people were about at that early hour.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now, what next?’ said the Prince. ‘I must take you to an hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am in your hands,’ she acquiesced, with a smile which sent the blood
      racing through his veins. He perceived now that she was tired and
      overcome, suffering from a sudden and natural reaction.
    </p>
<p>
      At the HÃ´tel Wellington the Prince told the sleepy door-keeper that they
      had come by the early train from Bruges, and wanted breakfast at once. It
      was absurdly early, but a common English sovereign will work wonders in
      any Belgian hotel, and in a very brief time Nella and the Prince were
      breakfasting on the verandah of the hotel upon chocolate that had been
      specially and hastily brewed for them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I never tasted such excellent chocolate,’ claimed the Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      The statement was wildly untrue, for the HÃ´tel Wellington is not
      celebrated for its chocolate. Nevertheless Nella replied enthusiastically,
      ‘Nor I.’
    </p>
<p>
      Then there was a silence, and Nella, feeling possibly that she had been
      too ecstatic, remarked in a very matter-of-fact tone: ‘I must telegraph to
      Papa instantly.’
    </p>
<p>
      Thus it was that Theodore Racksole received the telegram which drew him
      away from Detective Marshall.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Sixteen THE WOMAN WITH THE RED HAT
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘THERE is one thing, Prince, that we have just got to settle straight
      off,’ said Theodore Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      They were all three seated—Racksole, his daughter, and Prince
      Aribert—round a dinner table in a private room at the HÃ´tel
      Wellington. Racksole had duly arrived by the afternoon boat, and had been
      met on the quay by the other two. They had dined early, and Racksole had
      heard the full story of the adventures by sea and land of Nella and the
      Prince. As to his own adventure of the previous night he said very little,
      merely explaining, with as little detail as possible, that Dimmock’s body
      had come to light.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is that?’ asked the Prince, in answer to Racksole’s remark.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We have got to settle whether we shall tell the police at once all that
      has occurred, or whether we shall proceed on our own responsibility. There
      can be no doubt as to which course we ought to pursue. Every consideration
      of prudence points to the advisability of taking the police into our
      confidence, and leaving the matter entirely in their hands.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, Papa!’ Nella burst out in her pouting, impulsive way. ‘You surely
      can’t think of such a thing. Why, the fun has only just begun.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you call last night fun?’ questioned Racksole, gazing at her solemnly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, I do,’ she said promptly. ‘Now.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, I don’t,’ was the millionaire’s laconic response; but perhaps he
      was thinking of his own situation in the lift.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you not think we might investigate a little further,’ said the Prince
      judiciously, as he cracked a walnut, ‘just a little further—and
      then, if we fail to accomplish anything, there would still be ample
      opportunity to consult the police?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How do you suggest we should begin?’ asked Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, there is the house which Miss Racksole so intrepidly entered last
      evening’—he gave her the homage of an admiring glance; ‘you and I,
      Mr Racksole, might examine that abode in detail.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To-night?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly. We might do something.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We might do too much.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘For example?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We might shoot someone, or get ourselves mistaken for burglars. If we
      outstepped the law, it would be no excuse for us that we had been acting
      in a good cause.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘True,’ said the Prince. ‘Nevertheless—’ He stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nevertheless you have a distaste for bringing the police into the
      business.
    </p>
<p>
      You want the hunt all to yourself. You are on fire with the ardour of the
      chase. Is not that it? Accept the advice of an older man, Prince, and
      sleep on this affair. I have little fancy for nocturnal escapades two
      nights together. As for you, Nella, off with you to bed. The Prince and I
      will have a yarn over such fluids as can be obtained in this hole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Papa,’ she said, ‘you are perfectly horrid to-night.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps I am,’ he said. ‘Decidedly I am very cross with you for coming
      over here all alone. It was monstrous. If I didn’t happen to be the most
      foolish of parents—There! Good-night. It’s nine o’clock. The Prince,
      I am sure, will excuse you.’
    </p>
<p>
      If Nella had not really been very tired Prince Aribert might have been the
      witness of a good-natured but stubborn conflict between the millionaire
      and his spirited offspring. As it was, Nella departed with surprising
      docility, and the two men were left alone.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now,’ said Racksole suddenly, changing his tone, ‘I fancy that after all
      I’m your man for a little amateur investigation to-night. And, if I must
      speak the exact truth, I think that to sleep on this affair would be about
      the very worst thing we could do. But I was anxious to keep Nella out of
      harm’s way at any rate till to-morrow. She is a very difficult creature to
      manage, Prince, and I may warn you,’ he laughed grimly, ‘that if we do
      succeed in doing anything to-night we shall catch it from her ladyship in
      the morning. Are you ready to take that risk?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am,’ the Prince smiled. ‘But Miss Racksole is a young lady of quite
      remarkable nerve.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She is,’ said Racksole drily. ‘I wish sometimes she had less.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have the highest admiration for Miss Racksole,’ said the Prince, and he
      looked Miss Racksole’s father full in the face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You honour us, Prince,’ Racksole observed. ‘Let us come to business. Am I
      right in assuming that you have a reason for keeping the police out of
      this business, if it can possibly be done?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ said the Prince, and his brow clouded. ‘I am very much afraid that
      my poor nephew has involved himself in some scrape that he would wish not
      to be divulged.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you do not believe that he is the victim of foul play?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And the reason, if I may ask it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Racksole, we speak in confidence—is it not so? Some years ago my
      foolish nephew had an affair—an affair with a feminine star of the
      Berlin stage. For anything I know, the lady may have been the very pattern
      of her sex, but where a reigning Prince is concerned scandal cannot be
      avoided in such a matter. I had thought that the affair was quite at an
      end, since my nephew’s betrothal to Princess Anna of Eckstein-Schwartzburg
      is shortly to be announced. But yesterday I saw the lady to whom I have
      referred driving on the Digue. The coincidence of her presence here with
      my nephew’s disappearance is too extraordinary to be disregarded.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But how does this theory square with the murder of Reginald Dimmock?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It does not square with it. My idea is that the murder of poor Dimmock
      and the disappearance of my nephew are entirely unconnected—unless,
      indeed, this Berlin actress is playing into the hands of the murderers. I
      had not thought of that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then what do you propose to do to-night?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I propose to enter the house which Miss Racksole entered last night and
      to find out something definite.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I concur,’ said Racksole. ‘I shall heartily enjoy it. But let me tell
      you, Prince, and pardon me for speaking bluntly, your surmise is
      incorrect. I would wager a hundred thousand dollars that Prince Eugen has
      been kidnapped.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What grounds have you for being so sure?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! said Racksole, ‘that is a long story. Let me begin by asking you
      this.
    </p>
<p>
      Are you aware that your nephew, Prince Eugen, owes a million of money?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A million of money!’ cried Prince Aribert astonished. ‘It is impossible!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nevertheless, he does,’ said Racksole calmly. Then he told him all he had
      learnt from Mr Sampson Levi.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What have you to say to that?’ Racksole ended. Prince Aribert made no
      reply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What have you to say to that?’ Racksole insisted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Merely that Eugen is ruined, even if he is alive.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all,’ Racksole returned with cheerfulness. ‘Not at all. We shall
      see about that. The special thing that I want to know just now from you is
      this:
    </p>
<p>
      Has any previous application ever been made for the hand of the Princess
      Anna?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes. Last year. The King of Bosnia sued for it, but his proposal was
      declined.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because my nephew was considered to be a more suitable match for her.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not because the personal character of his Majesty of Bosnia is scarcely
      of the brightest?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No. Unfortunately it is usually impossible to consider questions of
      personal character when a royal match is concerned.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, if for any reason the marriage of Princess Anna with your nephew
      was frustrated, the King of Bosnia would have a fair chance in that
      quarter?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He would. The political aspect of things would be perfectly
      satisfactory.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thanks!’ said Racksole. ‘I will wager another hundred thousand dollars
      that someone in Bosnia—I don’t accuse the King himself—is at
      the bottom of this business. The methods of Balkan politicians have always
      been half-Oriental. Let us go.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To this precious house of Nella’s adventure.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But surely it is too early?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So it is,’ said Racksole, ‘and we shall want a few things, too. For
      instance, a dark lantern. I think I will go out and forage for a lantern.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And a revolver?’ suggested Prince Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Does it mean revolvers?’ The millionaire laughed. ‘It may come to that.’
      ‘Here you are, then, my friend,’ said Racksole, and he pulled one out of
      his hip pocket. ‘And yours?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I,’ said the Prince, ‘I have your daughter’s.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The deuce you have!’ murmured Racksole to himself.
    </p>
<p>
      It was then half past nine. They decided that it would be impolitic to
      begin their operations till after midnight. There were three hours to
      spare.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let us go and see the gambling,’ Racksole suggested. ‘We might encounter
      the Berlin lady.’
    </p>
<p>
      The suggestion, in the first instance, was not made seriously, but it
      appeared to both men that they might do worse than spend the intervening
      time in the gorgeous saloon of the Kursaal, where, in the season, as much
      money is won and lost as at Monte Carlo. It was striking ten o’clock as
      they entered the rooms. There was a large company present—a company
      which included some of the most notorious persons in Europe. In that
      multifarious assemblage all were equal. The electric light shone coldly
      and impartially on the just and on the unjust, on the fool and the knave,
      on the European and the Asiatic. As usual, women monopolized the best
      places at the tables.
    </p>
<p>
      The scene was familiar enough to Prince Aribert, who had witnessed it
      frequently at Monaco, but Theodore Racksole had never before entered any
      European gaming palace; he had only the haziest idea of the rules of play,
      and he was at once interested. For some time they watched the play at the
      table which happened to be nearest to them. Racksole never moved his lips.
    </p>
<p>
      With his eyes glued on the table, and ears open for every remark, of the
      players and the croupier, he took his first lesson in roulette. He saw a
      mere youth win fifteen thousand francs, which were stolen in the most
      barefaced manner by a rouged girl scarcely older than the youth; he saw
      two old gamesters stake their coins, and lose, and walk quietly out of the
      place; he saw the bank win fifty thousand francs at a single turn.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is rather good fun,’ he said at length, ‘but the stakes are too
      small to make it really exciting. I’ll try my luck, just for the
      experience. I’m bound to win.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why?’ asked the Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because I always do, in games of chance,’ Racksole answered with gay
      confidence. ‘It is my fate. Then to-night, you must remember, I shall be a
      beginner, and you know the tyro’s luck.’
    </p>
<p>
      In ten minutes the croupier of that table was obliged to suspend
      operations pending the arrival of a further supply of coin.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What did I tell you?’ said Racksole, leading the way to another table
      further up the room. A hundred curious glances went after him. One old
      woman, whose gay attire suggested a false youthfulness, begged him in
      French to stake a five-franc piece for her. She offered him the coin. He
      took it, and gave her a hundred-franc note in exchange. She clutched the
      crisp rustling paper, and with hysterical haste scuttled back to her own
      table.
    </p>
<p>
      At the second table there was a considerable air of excitement. In the
      forefront of the players was a woman in a low-cut evening dress of black
      silk and a large red picture hat. Her age appeared to be about
      twenty-eight; she had dark eyes, full lips, and a distinctly Jewish nose.
      She was handsome, but her beauty was of that forbidding, sinister order
      which is often called Junoesque. This woman was the centre of attraction.
      People said to each other that she had won a hundred and sixty thousand
      francs that day at the table.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You were right,’ Prince Aribert whispered to Theodore Racksole; ‘that is
      the Berlin lady.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The deuce she is! Has she seen you? Will she know you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She would probably know me, but she hasn’t looked up yet.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Keep behind her, then. I propose to find her a little occupation.’ By
      dint of a carefully-exercised diplomacy, Racksole manoeuvred himself into
      a seat opposite to the lady in the red hat. The fame of his success at the
      other table had followed him, and people regarded him as a serious and
      formidable player. In the first turn the lady put a thousand francs on
      double zero; Racksole put a hundred on number nineteen and a thousand on
      the odd numbers.
    </p>
<p>
      Nineteen won. Racksole received four thousand four hundred francs. Nine
      times in succession Racksole backed number nineteen and the odd numbers;
      nine times the lady backed double zero. Nine times Racksole won and the
      lady lost. The other players, perceiving that the affair had resolved
      itself into a duel, stood back for the most part and watched those two.
      Prince Aribert never stirred from his position behind the great red hat.
      The game continued. Racksole lost trifles from time to time, but
      ninety-nine hundredths of the luck was with him. As an English spectator
      at the table remarked, ‘he couldn’t do wrong.’ When midnight struck the
      lady in the red hat was reduced to a thousand francs. Then she fell into a
      winning vein for half an hour, but at one o’clock her resources were
      exhausted. Of the hundred and sixty thousand francs which she was reputed
      to have had early in the evening, Racksole held about ninety thousand, and
      the bank had the rest.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a calamity for the Juno of the red hat. She jumped up, stamped her
      foot, and hurried from the room. At a discreet distance Racksole and the
      Prince pursued her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It might be well to ascertain her movements,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      Outside, in the glare of the great arc lights, and within sound of the
      surf which beats always at the very foot of the Kursaal, the Juno of the
      red hat summoned a fiacre and drove rapidly away. Racksole and the Prince
      took an open carriage and started in pursuit. They had not, however,
      travelled more than half a mile when Prince Aribert stopped the carriage,
      and, bidding Racksole get out, paid the driver and dismissed him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I feel sure I know where she is going,’ he explained, ‘and it will be
      better for us to follow on foot.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You mean she is making for the scene of last night’s affair?’ said
      Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Exactly. We shall—what you call, kill two birds with one stone.’
    </p>
<p>
      Prince Aribert’s guess was correct. The lady’s carriage stopped in front
      of the house where Nella Racksole and Miss Spencer had had their interview
      on the previous evening, and the lady vanished into the building just as
      the two men appeared at the end of the street. Instead of proceeding along
      that street, the Prince led Racksole to the lane which gave on to the
      backs of the houses, and he counted the houses as they went up the lane.
      In a few minutes they had burglariously climbed over a wall, and crept,
      with infinite caution, up a long, narrow piece of ground—half
      garden, half paved yard, till they crouched under a window—a window
      which was shielded by curtains, but which had been left open a little.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Listen,’ said the Prince in his lightest whisper, ‘they are talking.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Berlin lady and Miss Spencer. I’m sure it’s Miss Spencer’s voice.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole boldly pushed the french window a little wider open, and put his
      ear to the aperture, through which came a beam of yellow light.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Take my place,’ he whispered to the Prince, ‘they’re talking German.
      You’ll understand better.’
    </p>
<p>
      Silently they exchanged places under the window, and the Prince listened
      intently.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you refuse?’ Miss Spencer’s visitor was saying.
    </p>
<p>
      There was no answer from Miss Spencer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not even a thousand francs? I tell you I’ve lost the whole twenty-five
      thousand.’
    </p>
<p>
      Again no answer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then I’ll tell the whole story,’ the lady went on, in an angry rush of
      words. ‘I did what I promised to do. I enticed him here, and you’ve got
      him safe in your vile cellar, poor little man, and you won’t give me a
      paltry thousand francs.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have already had your price.’ The words were Miss Spencer’s. They
      fell cold and calm on the night air.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want another thousand.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I haven’t it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then we’ll see.’
    </p>
<p>
      Prince Aribert heard a rustle of flying skirts; then another movement—a
      door banged, and the beam of light through the aperture of the window
      suddenly disappeared. He pushed the window wide open. The room was in
      darkness, and apparently empty.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now for that lantern of yours,’ he said eagerly to Theodore Racksole,
      after he had translated to him the conversation of the two women, Racksole
      produced the dark lantern from the capacious pocket of his dust coat, and
      lighted it. The ray flashed about the ground.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is it?’ exclaimed Prince Aribert with a swift cry, pointing to the
      ground. The lantern threw its light on a perpendicular grating at their
      feet, through which could be discerned a cellar. They both knelt down, and
      peered into the subterranean chamber. On a broken chair a young man sat
      listlessly with closed eyes, his head leaning heavily forward on his
      chest.
    </p>
<p>
      In the feeble light of the lantern he had the livid and ghastly appearance
      of a corpse.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who can it be?’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is Eugen,’ was the Prince’s low answer.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Seventeen THE RELEASE OF PRINCE EUGEN
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘EUGEN,’ Prince Aribert called softly. At the sound of his own name the
      young man in the cellar feebly raised his head and stared up at the
      grating which separated him from his two rescuers. But his features showed
      no recognition. He gazed in an aimless, vague, silly manner for a few
      seconds, his eyes blinking under the glare of the lantern, and then his
      head slowly drooped again on to his chest. He was dressed in a dark tweed
      travelling suit, and Racksole observed that one sleeve—the left—was
      torn across the upper part of the cuff, and that there were stains of dirt
      on the left shoulder. A soiled linen collar, which had lost all its starch
      and was half unbuttoned, partially encircled the captive’s neck; his brown
      boots were unlaced; a cap, a handkerchief, a portion of a watch-chain, and
      a few gold coins lay on the floor. Racksole flashed the lantern into the
      corners of the cellar, but he could discover no other furniture except the
      chair on which the Hereditary Prince of Posen sat and a small deal table
      on which were a plate and a cup.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Eugen,’ cried Prince Aribert once more, but this time his forlorn nephew
      made no response whatever, and then Aribert added in a low voice to
      Racksole: ‘Perhaps he cannot see us clearly.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But he must surely recognize your voice,’ said Racksole, in a hard,
      gloomy tone. There was a pause, and the two men above ground looked at
      each other hesitatingly. Each knew that they must enter that cellar and
      get Prince Eugen out of it, and each was somehow afraid to take the next
      step.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thank God he is not dead!’ said Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He may be worse than dead!’ Racksole replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Worse than—What do you mean?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean—he may be mad.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come,’ Aribert almost shouted, with a sudden access of energy—a
      wild impulse for action. And, snatching the lantern from Racksole, he
      rushed into the dark room where they had heard the conversation of Miss
      Spencer and the lady in the red hat. For a moment Racksole did not stir
      from the threshold of the window. ‘Come,’ Prince Aribert repeated, and
      there was an imperious command in his utterance. ‘What are you afraid of?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know,’ said Racksole, feeling stupid and queer; ‘I don’t know.’
    </p>
<p>
      Then he marched heavily after Prince Aribert into the room. On the
      mantelpiece were a couple of candles which had been blown out, and in a
      mechanical, unthinking way, Racksole lighted them, and the two men glanced
      round the room. It presented no peculiar features: it was just an ordinary
      room, rather small, rather mean, rather shabby, with an ugly wallpaper and
      ugly pictures in ugly frames. Thrown over a chair was a man’s
      evening-dress jacket. The door was closed. Prince Aribert turned the knob,
      but he could not open it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s locked,’ he said. ‘Evidently they know we’re here.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nonsense,’ said Racksole brusquely; ‘how can they know?’ And, taking hold
      of the knob, he violently shook the door, and it opened. ‘I told you it
      wasn’t locked,’ he added, and this small success of opening the door
      seemed to steady the man. It was a curious psychological effect, this
      terrorizing (for it amounted to that) of two courageous full-grown men by
      the mere apparition of a helpless creature in a cellar. Gradually they
      both recovered from it. The next moment they were out in the passage which
      led to the front door of the house. The front door stood open. They looked
      into the street, up and down, but there was not a soul in sight. The
      street, lighted by three gas-lamps only, seemed strangely sinister and
      mysterious.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She has gone, that’s clear,’ said Racksole, meaning the woman with the
      red hat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And Miss Spencer after her, do you think?’ questioned Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No. She would stay. She would never dare to leave. Let us find the cellar
      steps.’
    </p>
<p>
      The cellar steps were happily not difficult to discover, for in moving a
      pace backwards Prince Aribert had a narrow escape of precipitating himself
      to the bottom of them. The lantern showed that they were built on a curve.
    </p>
<p>
      Silently Racksole resumed possession of the lantern and went first, the
      Prince close behind him. At the foot was a short passage, and in this
      passage crouched the figure of a woman. Her eyes threw back the rays of
      the lantern, shining like a cat’s at midnight. Then, as the men went
      nearer, they saw that it was Miss Spencer who barred their way. She seemed
      half to kneel on the stone floor, and in one hand she held what at first
      appeared to be a dagger, but which proved to be nothing more romantic than
      a rather long bread-knife.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I heard you, I heard you,’ she exclaimed. ‘Get back; you mustn’t come
      here.’
    </p>
<p>
      There was a desperate and dangerous look on her face, and her form shook
      with scarcely controlled passionate energy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now see here, Miss Spencer,’ Racksole said calmly, ‘I guess we’ve had
      enough of this fandango. You’d better get up and clear out, or we’ll just
      have to drag you off.’
    </p>
<p>
      He went calmly up to her, the lantern in his hand. Without another word
      she struck the knife into his arm, and the lantern fell extinguished.
      Racksole gave a cry, rather of angry surprise than of pain, and retreated
      a few steps. In the darkness they could still perceive the glint of her
      eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I told you you mustn’t come here,’ the woman said. ‘Now get back.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole positively laughed. It was a queer laugh, but he laughed, and he
      could not help it. The idea of this woman, this bureau clerk, stopping his
      progress and that of Prince Aribert by means of a bread-knife aroused his
      sense of humour. He struck a match, relighted the candle, and faced Miss
      Spencer once more.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ll do it again,’ she said, with a note of hard resolve.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, no, you won’t, my girl,’ said Racksole; and he pulled out his
      revolver, cocked it, raised his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Put down that plaything of yours,’ he said firmly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ she answered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall shoot.’
    </p>
<p>
      She pressed her lips together.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I shall shoot,’ he repeated. ‘One—two—three.’
    </p>
<p>
      Bang, bang! He had fired twice, purposely missing her. Miss Spencer never
      blenched. Racksole was tremendously surprised—and he would have been
      a thousandfold more surprised could he have contrasted her behaviour now
      with her abject terror on the previous evening when Nella had threatened
      her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’ve got a bit of pluck,’ he said, ‘but it won’t help you. Why won’t
      you let us pass?’
    </p>
<p>
      As a matter of fact, pluck was just what she had not, really; she had
      merely subordinated one terror to another. She was desperately afraid of
      Racksole’s revolver, but she was much more afraid of something else.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why won’t you let us pass?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I daren’t,’ she said, with a plaintive tremor; ‘Tom put me in charge.’
    </p>
<p>
      That was all. The men could see tears running down her poor wrinkled face.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole began to take off his light overcoat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I see I must take my coat off to you,’ he said, and he almost smiled.
      Then, with a quick movement, he threw the coat over Miss Spencer’s head
      and flew at her, seizing both her arms, while Prince Aribert assisted.
    </p>
<p>
      Her struggles ceased—she was beaten.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s all right,’ said Racksole: ‘I could never have used that revolver—to
      mean business with it, of course.’
    </p>
<p>
      They carried her, unresisting, upstairs and on to the upper floor, where
      they locked her in a bedroom. She lay in the bed as if exhausted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now for my poor Eugen,’ said Prince Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t you think we’d better search the house first?’ Racksole suggested;
      ‘it will be safer to know just how we stand. We can’t afford any ambushes
      or things of that kind, you know.’
    </p>
<p>
      The Prince agreed, and they searched the house from top to bottom, but
      found no one. Then, having locked the front door and the french window of
      the sitting-room, they proceeded again to the cellar.
    </p>
<p>
      Here a new obstacle confronted them. The cellar door was, of course,
      locked; there was no sign of a key, and it appeared to be a heavy door.
      They were compelled to return to the bedroom where Miss Spencer was
      incarcerated, in order to demand the key of the cellar from her. She still
      lay without movement on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tom’s got it,’ she replied, faintly, to their question: ‘Tom’s got it, I
      swear to you. He took it for safety.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then how do you feed your prisoner?’ Racksole asked sharply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Through the grating,’ she answered.
    </p>
<p>
      Both men shuddered. They felt she was speaking the truth. For the third
      time they went to the cellar door. In vain Racksole thrust himself against
      it; he could do no more than shake it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let’s try both together,’ said Prince Aribert. ‘Now!’ There was a crack.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Again,’ said Prince Aribert. There was another crack, and then the upper
      hinge gave way. The rest was easy. Over the wreck of the door they entered
      Prince Eugen’s prison.
    </p>
<p>
      The captive still sat on his chair. The terrific noise and bustle of
      breaking down the door seemed not to have aroused him from his lethargy,
      but when Prince Aribert spoke to him in German he looked at his uncle.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Will you not come with us, Eugen?’ said Prince Aribert; ‘you needn’t stay
      here any longer, you know.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Leave me alone,’ was the strange reply; ‘leave me alone. What do you
      want?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We are here to get you out of this scrape,’ said Aribert gently. Racksole
      stood aside.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who is that fellow?’ said Eugen sharply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is my friend Mr Racksole, an Englishman—or rather, I should
      say, an American—to whom we owe a great deal. Come and have supper,
      Eugen.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I won’t,’ answered Eugen doggedly. ‘I’m waiting here for her. You didn’t
      think anyone had kept me here, did you, against my will? I tell you I’m
      waiting for her. She said she’d come.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who is she?’ Aribert asked, humouring him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She! Why, you know! I forgot, of course, you don’t know. You mustn’t ask.
    </p>
<p>
      Don’t pry, Uncle Aribert. She was wearing a red hat.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ll take you to her, my dear Eugen.’ Prince Aribert put his hands on the
      other’s shoulder, but Eugen shook him off violently, stood up, and then
      sat down again.
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert looked at Racksole, and they both looked at Prince Eugen. The
      latter’s face was flushed, and Racksole observed that the left pupil was
      more dilated than the right. The man started, muttered odd, fragmentary
      scraps of sentences, now grumbling, now whining.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘His mind is unhinged,’ Racksole whispered in English.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hush!’ said Prince Aribert. ‘He understands English.’ But Prince Eugen
      took no notice of the brief colloquy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We had better get him upstairs, somehow,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ Aribert assented. ‘Eugen, the lady with the red hat, the lady you
      are waiting for, is upstairs. She has sent us down to ask you to come up.
      Won’t you come?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Himmel!’ the poor fellow exclaimed, with a kind of weak anger. ‘Why did
      you not say this before?’
    </p>
<p>
      He rose, staggered towards Aribert, and fell headlong on the floor. He had
      swooned. The two men raised him, carried him up the stone steps, and laid
      him with infinite care on a sofa. He lay, breathing queerly through the
      nostrils, his eyes closed, his fingers contracted; every now and then a
      convulsion ran through his frame.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One of us must fetch a doctor,’ said Prince Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will,’ said Racksole. At that moment there was a quick, curt rap on the
      french window, and both Racksole and the Prince glanced round startled. A
      girl’s face was pressed against the large window-pane. It was Nella’s.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole unfastened the catch, and she entered.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have found you,’ she said lightly; ‘you might have told me. I couldn’t
      sleep. I inquired from the hotel-folks if you had retired, and they said
      no; so I slipped out. I guessed where you were.’ Racksole interrupted her
      with a question as to what she meant by this escapade, but she stopped him
      with a careless gesture. ‘What’s this?’ She pointed to the form on the
      sofa.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is my nephew, Prince Eugen,’ said Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hurt?’ she inquired coldly. ‘I hope not.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He is ill,’ said Racksole, ‘his brain is turned.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella began to examine the unconscious Prince with the expert movements of
      a girl who had passed through the best hospital course to be obtained in
      New York.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He has got brain fever,’ she said. ‘That is all, but it will be enough.
      Do you know if there is a bed anywhere in this remarkable house?’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Eighteen IN THE NIGHT-TIME
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘HE must on no account be moved,’ said the dark little Belgian doctor,
      whose eyes seemed to peer so quizzically through his spectacles; and he
      said it with much positiveness.
    </p>
<p>
      That pronouncement rather settled their plans for them. It was certainly a
      professional triumph for Nella, who, previous to the doctor’s arrival, had
      told them the very same thing. Considerable argument had passed before the
      doctor was sent for. Prince Aribert was for keeping the whole affair a
      deep secret among their three selves. Theodore Racksole agreed so far, but
      he suggested further that at no matter what risk they should transport the
      patient over to England at once. Racksole had an idea that he should feel
      safer in that hotel of his, and better able to deal with any situation
      that might arise. Nella scorned the idea. In her quality of an amateur
      nurse, she assured them that Prince Eugen was much more seriously ill than
      either of them suspected, and she urged that they should take absolute
      possession of the house, and keep possession till Prince Eugen was
      convalescent.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what about the Spencer female?’ Racksole had said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Keep her where she is. Keep her a prisoner. And hold the house against
      all comers. If Jules should come back, simply defy him to enter—that
      is all.
    </p>
<p>
      There are two of you, so you must keep an eye on the former occupiers, if
      they return, and on Miss Spencer, while I nurse the patient. But first,
      you must send for a doctor.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Doctor!’ Prince Aribert had said, alarmed. ‘Will it not be necessary to
      make some awkward explanation to the doctor?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all!’ she replied. ‘Why should it be? In a place like Ostend
      doctors are far too discreet to ask questions; they see too much to retain
      their curiosity. Besides, do you want your nephew to die?’
    </p>
<p>
      Both the men were somewhat taken aback by the girl’s sagacious grasp of
      the situation, and it came about that they began to obey her like
      subordinates.
    </p>
<p>
      She told her father to sally forth in search of a doctor, and he went. She
      gave Prince Aribert certain other orders, and he promptly executed them.
    </p>
<p>
      By the evening of the following day, everything was going smoothly. The
      doctor came and departed several times, and sent medicine, and seemed
      fairly optimistic as to the issue of the illness. An old woman had been
      induced to come in and cook and clean. Miss Spencer was kept out of sight
      on the attic floor, pending some decision as to what to do with her. And
      no one outside the house had asked any questions. The inhabitants of that
      particular street must have been accustomed to strange behaviour on the
      part of their neighbours, unaccountable appearances and disappearances,
      strange flittings and arrivals. This strong-minded and active trio—Racksole,
      Nella, and Prince Aribert—might have been the lawful and accustomed
      tenants of the house, for any outward evidence to the contrary.
    </p>
<p>
      On the afternoon of the third day Prince Eugen was distinctly and
      seriously worse. Nella had sat up with him the previous night and
      throughout the day.
    </p>
<p>
      Her father had spent the morning at the hotel, and Prince Aribert had kept
      watch. The two men were never absent from the house at the same time, and
      one of them always did duty as sentinel at night. On this afternoon Prince
      Aribert and Nella sat together in the patient’s bedroom. The doctor had
      just left. Theodore Racksole was downstairs reading the New York Herald.
      The Prince and Nella were near the window, which looked on to the
      back-garden.
    </p>
<p>
      It was a queer shabby little bedroom to shelter the august body of a
      European personage like Prince Eugen of Posen. Curiously enough, both
      Nella and her father, ardent democrats though they were, had been somehow
      impressed by the royalty and importance of the fever-stricken Prince—impressed
      as they had never been by Aribert. They had both felt that here, under
      their care, was a species of individuality quite new to them, and
      different from anything they had previously encountered. Even the gestures
      and tones of his delirium had an air of abrupt yet condescending command—an
      imposing mixture of suavity and haughtiness. As for Nella, she had been
      first struck by the beautiful ‘E’ over a crown on the sleeves of his
      linen, and by the signet ring on his pale, emaciated hand. After all,
      these trifling outward signs are at least as effective as others of deeper
      but less obtrusive significance. The Racksoles, too, duly marked the
      attitude of Prince Aribert to his nephew: it was at once paternal and
      reverential; it disclosed clearly that Prince Aribert continued, in spite
      of everything, to regard his nephew as his sovereign lord and master, as a
      being surrounded by a natural and inevitable pomp and awe. This attitude,
      at the beginning, seemed false and unreal to the Americans; it seemed to
      them to be assumed; but gradually they came to perceive that they were
      mistaken, and that though America might have cast out ‘the monarchial
      superstition’, nevertheless that ‘superstition’ had vigorously survived in
      another part of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You and Mr Racksole have been extraordinarily kind to me,’ said Prince
      Aribert very quietly, after the two had sat some time in silence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why? How?’ she asked unaffectedly. ‘We are interested in this affair
      ourselves, you know. It began at our hotel—you mustn’t forget that,
      Prince.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t,’ he said. ‘I forget nothing. But I cannot help feeling that I
      have led you into a strange entanglement. Why should you and Mr Racksole
      be here—you who are supposed to be on a holiday!—hiding in a
      strange house in a foreign country, subject to all sorts of annoyances and
      all sorts of risks, simply because I am anxious to avoid scandal, to avoid
      any sort of talk, in connection with my misguided nephew? It is nothing to
      you that the Hereditary Prince of Posen should be liable to a public
      disgrace. What will it matter to you if the throne of Posen becomes the
      laughing-stock of Europe?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I really don’t know, Prince,’ Nella smiled roguishly. ‘But we Americans
      have, a habit of going right through with anything we have begun.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ he said, ‘who knows how this thing will end? All our trouble, our
      anxieties, our watchfulness, may come to nothing. I tell you that when I
      see Eugen lying there, and think that we cannot learn his story until he
      recovers, I am ready to go mad. We might be arranging things, making
      matters smooth, preparing for the future, if only we knew—knew what
      he can tell us. I tell you that I am ready to go mad. If anything should
      happen to you, Miss Racksole, I would kill myself.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But why?’ she questioned. ‘Supposing, that is, that anything could happen
      to me—which it can’t.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because I have dragged you into this,’ he replied, gazing at her. ‘It is
      nothing to you. You are only being kind.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How do you know it is nothing to me, Prince?’ she asked him quickly.
    </p>
<p>
      Just then the sick man made a convulsive movement, and Nella flew to the
      bed and soothed him. From the head of the bed she looked over at Prince
      Aribert, and he returned her bright, excited glance. She was in her
      travelling-frock, with a large white Belgian apron tied over it. Large
      dark circles of fatigue and sleeplessness surrounded her eyes, and to the
      Prince her cheek seemed hollow and thin; her hair lay thick over the
      temples, half covering the ears. Aribert gave no answer to her query—merely
      gazed at her with melancholy intensity.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think I will go and rest,’ she said at last. ‘You will know all about
      the medicine.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sleep well,’ he said, as he softly opened the door for her. And then he
      was alone with Eugen. It was his turn that night to watch, for they still
      half-expected some strange, sudden visit, or onslaught, or move of one
      kind or another from Jules. Racksole slept in the parlour on the ground
      floor.
    </p>
<p>
      Nella had the front bedroom on the first floor; Miss Spencer was immured
      in the attic; the last-named lady had been singularly quiet and incurious,
      taking her food from Nella and asking no questions, the old woman went at
      nights to her own abode in the purlieus of the harbour. Hour after hour
      Aribert sat silent by his nephew’s bed-side, attending mechanically to his
      wants, and every now and then gazing hard into the vacant, anguished face,
      as if trying to extort from that mask the secrets which it held. Aribert
      was tortured by the idea that if he could have only half an hour’s, only a
      quarter of an hour’s, rational speech with Prince Eugen, all might be
      cleared up and put right, and by the fact that that rational talk was
      absolutely impossible on Eugen’s part until the fever had run its course.
      As the minutes crept on to midnight the watcher, made nervous by the
      intense, electrical atmosphere which seems always to surround a person who
      is dangerously ill, grew more and more a prey to vague and terrible
      apprehensions. His mind dwelt hysterically on the most fatal
      possibilities.
    </p>
<p>
      He wondered what would occur if by any ill-chance Eugen should die in that
      bed—how he would explain the affair to Posen and to the Emperor, how
      he would justify himself. He saw himself being tried for murder, sentenced
      (him—a Prince of the blood!), led to the scaffold... a scene
      unparalleled in Europe for over a century! ... Then he gazed anew at the
      sick man, and thought he saw death in every drawn feature of that agonized
      face. He could have screamed aloud. His ears heard a peculiar resonant
      boom. He started—it was nothing but the city clock striking twelve.
      But there was another sound—a mysterious shuffle at the door. He
      listened; then jumped from his chair. Nothing now! Nothing! But still he
      felt drawn to the door, and after what seemed an interminable interval he
      went and opened it, his heart beating furiously. Nella lay in a heap on
      the door mat. She was fully dressed, but had apparently lost
      consciousness. He clutched at her slender body, picked her up, carried her
      to the chair by the fire-place, and laid her in it. He had forgotten all
      about Eugen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is it, my angel?’ he whispered, and then he kissed her—kissed
      her twice. He could only look at her; he did not know what to do to
      succour her.
    </p>
<p>
      At last she opened her eyes and sighed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where am I?’ she asked vaguely, in a tremulous tone as she recognized
      him. ‘Is it you? Did I do anything silly? Did I faint?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What has happened? Were you ill?’ he questioned anxiously. He was
      kneeling at her feet, holding her hand tight.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I saw Jules by the side of my bed,’ she murmured; ‘I’m sure I saw him; he
      laughed at me. I had not undressed. I sprang up, frightened, but he had
      gone, and then I ran downstairs—to you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You were dreaming,’ he soothed her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Was I?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You must have been. I have not heard a sound. No one could have entered.
    </p>
<p>
      But if you like I will wake Mr Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Perhaps I was dreaming,’ she admitted. ‘How foolish!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You were over-tired,’ he said, still unconsciously holding her hand. They
      gazed at each other. She smiled at him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You kissed me,’ she said suddenly, and he blushed red and stood up before
      her. ‘Why did you kiss me?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! Miss Racksole,’ he murmured, hurrying the words out. ‘Forgive me. It
      is unforgivable, but forgive me. I was overpowered by my feelings. I did
      not know what I was doing.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you kiss me?’ she repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because—Nella! I love you. I have no right to say it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why have you no right to say it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If Eugen dies, I shall owe a duty to Posen—I shall be its ruler.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well!’ she said calmly, with an adorable confidence. ‘Papa is worth forty
      millions. Would you not abdicate?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ he gave a low cry. ‘Will you force me to say these things? I could
      not shirk my duty to Posen, and the reigning Prince of Posen can only
      marry a Princess.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But Prince Eugen will live,’ she said positively, ‘and if he lives—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then I shall be free. I would renounce all my rights to make you mine, if—if—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If what, Prince?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you would deign to accept my hand.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Am I, then, rich enough?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nella!’ He bent down to her.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there was a crash of breaking glass. Aribert went to the window and
      opened it. In the starlit gloom he could see that a ladder had been raised
      against the back of the house. He thought he heard footsteps at the end of
      the garden.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It was Jules,’ he exclaimed to Nella, and without another word rushed
      upstairs to the attic. The attic was empty. Miss Spencer had mysteriously
      vanished.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Nineteen ROYALTY AT THE GRAND BABYLON
    </h2>
<p>
      THE Royal apartments at the Grand Babylon are famous in the world of
      hotels, and indeed elsewhere, as being, in their own way, unsurpassed.
      Some of the palaces of Germany, and in particular those of the mad Ludwig
      of Bavaria, may possess rooms and saloons which outshine them in gorgeous
      luxury and the mere wild fairy-like extravagance of wealth; but there is
      nothing, anywhere, even on Eighth Avenue, New York, which can fairly be
      called more complete, more perfect, more enticing, or—not least
      important—more comfortable.
    </p>
<p>
      The suite consists of six chambers—the ante-room, the saloon or
      audience chamber, the dining-room, the yellow drawing-room (where Royalty
      receives its friends), the library, and the State bedroom—to the
      last of which we have already been introduced. The most important and most
      impressive of these is, of course, the audience chamber, an apartment
      fifty feet long by forty feet broad, with a superb outlook over the
      Thames, the Shot Tower, and the higher signals of the South-Western
      Railway. The decoration of this room is mainly in the German taste, since
      four out of every six of its Royal occupants are of Teutonic blood; but
      its chief glory is its French ceiling, a masterpiece by Fragonard, taken
      bodily from a certain famous palace on the Loire. The walls are of
      panelled oak, with an eight-foot dado of Arras cloth imitated from unique
      Continental examples. The carpet, woven in one piece, is an antique
      specimen of the finest Turkish work, and it was obtained, a bargain, by
      Felix Babylon, from an impecunious Roumanian Prince. The silver
      candelabra, now fitted with electric light, came from the Rhine, and each
      had a separate history. The Royal chair—it is not etiquette to call
      it a throne, though it amounts to a throne—was looted by Napoleon
      from an Austrian city, and bought by Felix Babylon at the sale of a French
      collector. At each corner of the room stands a gigantic grotesque vase of
      German faïence of the sixteenth century. These were presented to Felix
      Babylon by William the First of Germany, upon the conclusion of his first
      incognito visit to London in connection with the French trouble of 1875.
    </p>
<p>
      There is only one picture in the audience chamber. It is a portrait of the
      luckless but noble Dom Pedro, Emperor of the Brazils. Given to Felix
      Babylon by Dom Pedro himself, it hangs there solitary and sublime as a
      reminder to Kings and Princes that Empires may pass away and greatness
      fall. A certain Prince who was occupying the suite during the Jubilee of
      1887—when the Grand Babylon had seven persons of Royal blood under
      its roof—sent a curt message to Felix that the portrait must be
      removed. Felix respectfully declined to remove it, and the Prince left for
      another hotel, where he was robbed of two thousand pounds’ worth of
      jewellery. The Royal audience chamber of the Grand Babylon, if people only
      knew it, is one of the sights of London, but it is never shown, and if you
      ask the hotel servants about its wonders they will tell you only foolish
      facts concerning it, as that the Turkey carpet costs fifty pounds to
      clean, and that one of the great vases is cracked across the pedestal,
      owing to the rough treatment accorded to it during a riotous game of Blind
      Man’s Buff, played one night by four young Princesses, a Balkan King, and
      his aides-de-camp.
    </p>
<p>
      In one of the window recesses of this magnificent apartment, on a certain
      afternoon in late July, stood Prince Aribert of Posen. He was faultlessly
      dressed in the conventional frock-coat of English civilization, with a
      gardenia in his button-hole, and the indispensable crease down the front
      of the trousers. He seemed to be fairly amused, and also to expect
      someone, for at frequent intervals he looked rapidly over his shoulder in
      the direction of the door behind the Royal chair. At last a little
      wizened, stooping old man, with a distinctly German cast of countenance,
      appeared through the door, and laid some papers on a small table by the
      side of the chair.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah, Hans, my old friend!’ said Aribert, approaching the old man. ‘I must
      have a little talk with you about one or two matters. How do you find His
      Royal Highness?’
    </p>
<p>
      The old man saluted, military fashion. ‘Not very well, your Highness,’ he
      answered. ‘I’ve been valet to your Highness’s nephew since his majority,
      and I was valet to his Royal father before him, but I never saw—’ He
      stopped, and threw up his wrinkled hands deprecatingly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You never saw what?’ Aribert smiled affectionately on the old fellow. You
      could perceive that these two, so sharply differentiated in rank, had been
      intimate in the past, and would be intimate again.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you know, my Prince,’ said the old man, ‘that we are to receive the
      financier, Sampson Levi—is that his name?—in the audience
      chamber? Surely, if I may humbly suggest, the library would have been good
      enough for a financier?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One would have thought so,’ agreed Prince Aribert, ‘but perhaps your
      master has a special reason. Tell me,’ he went on, changing the subject
      quickly, ‘how came it that you left the Prince, my nephew, at Ostend, and
      returned to Posen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘His orders, Prince,’ and old Hans, who had had a wide experience of Royal
      whims and knew half the secrets of the Courts of Europe, gave Aribert a
      look which might have meant anything. ‘He sent me back on an—an
      errand, your Highness.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you were to rejoin him here?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just so, Highness. And I did rejoin him here, although, to tell the
      truth, I had begun to fear that I might never see my master again.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Prince has been very ill in Ostend, Hans.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So I have gathered,’ Hans responded drily, slowly rubbing his hands
      together. ‘And his Highness is not yet perfectly recovered.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not yet. We despaired of his life, Hans, at one time, but thanks to an
      excellent constitution, he came safely through the ordeal.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We must take care of him, your Highness.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, indeed,’ said Aribert solemnly, ‘his life is very precious to
      Posen.’
    </p>
<p>
      At that moment, Eugen, Hereditary Prince of Posen, entered the audience
      chamber. He was pale and languid, and his uniform seemed to be a trouble
      to him. His hair had been slightly ruffled, and there was a look of
      uneasiness, almost of alarmed unrest, in his fine dark eyes. He was like a
      man who is afraid to look behind him lest he should see something there
      which ought not to be there. But at the same time, here beyond doubt was
      Royalty. Nothing could have been more striking than the contrast between
      Eugen, a sick man in the shabby house at Ostend, and this Prince Eugen in
      the Royal apartments of the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel, surrounded by the luxury
      and pomp which modern civilization can offer to those born in high places.
      All the desperate episode of Ostend was now hidden, passed over. It was
      supposed never to have occurred. It existed only like a secret shame in
      the hearts of those who had witnessed it. Prince Eugen had recovered; at
      any rate, he was convalescent, and he had been removed to London, where he
      took up again the dropped thread of his princely life. The lady with the
      red hat, the incorruptible and savage Miss Spencer, the unscrupulous and
      brilliant Jules, the dark, damp cellar, the horrible little bedroom—these
      things were over. Thanks to Prince Aribert and the Racksoles, he had
      emerged from them in safety. He was able to resume his public and official
      career. The Emperor had been informed of his safe arrival in London, after
      an unavoidable delay in Ostend; his name once more figured in the Court
      chronicle of the newspapers. In short, everything was smothered over. Only—only
      Jules, Rocco, and Miss Spencer were still at large; and the body of
      Reginald Dimmock lay buried in the domestic mausoleum of the palace at
      Posen; and Prince Eugen had still to interview Mr Sampson Levi.
    </p>
<p>
      That various matters lay heavy on the mind of Prince Eugen was beyond
      question. He seemed to have withdrawn within himself. Despite the
      extraordinary experiences through which he had recently passed, events
      which called aloud for explanations and confidence between the nephew and
      the uncle, he would say scarcely a word to Prince Aribert. Any allusion,
      however direct, to the days at Ostend, was ignored by him with more or
      less ingenuity, and Prince Aribert was really no nearer a full solution of
      the mystery of Jules’ plot than he had been on the night when he and
      Racksole visited the gaming tables at Ostend. Eugen was well aware that he
      had been kidnapped through the agency of the woman in the red hat, but,
      doubtless ashamed at having been her dupe, he would not proceed in any way
      with the clearing-up of the matter.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will receive in this room, Eugen?’ Aribert questioned him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ was the answer, given pettishly. ‘Why not? Even if I have no proper
      retinue here, surely that is no reason why I should not hold audience in a
      proper manner?... Hans, you can go.’ The old valet promptly disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aribert,’ the Hereditary Prince continued, when they were alone in the
      chamber, ‘you think I am mad.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear Eugen,’ said Prince Aribert, startled in spite of himself. ‘Don’t
      be absurd.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I say you think I am mad. You think that that attack of brain fever has
      left its permanent mark on me. Well, perhaps I am mad. Who can tell? God
      knows that I have been through enough lately to drive me mad.’
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert made no reply. As a matter of strict fact, the thought had crossed
      his mind that Eugen’s brain had not yet recovered its normal tone and
      activity. This speech of his nephew’s, however, had the effect of
      immediately restoring his belief in the latter’s entire sanity. He felt
      convinced that if only he could regain his nephew’s confidence, the old
      brotherly confidence which had existed between them since the years when
      they played together as boys, all might yet be well. But at present there
      appeared to be no sign that Eugen meant to give his confidence to anyone.
    </p>
<p>
      The young Prince had come up out of the valley of the shadow of death, but
      some of the valley’s shadow had clung to him, and it seemed he was unable
      to dissipate it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘By the way,’ said Eugen suddenly, ‘I must reward these Racksoles, I
      suppose. I am indeed grateful to them. If I gave the girl a bracelet, and
      the father a thousand guineas—how would that meet the case?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear Eugen!’ exclaimed Aribert aghast. ‘A thousand guineas! Do you
      know that Theodore Racksole could buy up all Posen from end to end without
      making himself a pauper. A thousand guineas! You might as well offer him
      sixpence.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then what must I offer?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing, except your thanks. Anything else would be an insult. These are
      no ordinary hotel people.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Can’t I give the little girl a bracelet?’ Prince Eugen gave a sinister
      laugh.
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert looked at him steadily. ‘No,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why did you kiss her—that night?’ asked Prince Eugen carelessly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Kiss whom?’ said Aribert, blushing and angry, despite his most determined
      efforts to keep calm and unconcerned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Racksole girl.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘When do you mean?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean,’ said Prince Eugen, ‘that night in Ostend when I was ill. You
      thought I was in a delirium. Perhaps I was. But somehow I remember that
      with extraordinary distinctness. I remember raising my head for a fraction
      of an instant, and just in that fraction of an instant you kissed her. Oh,
      Uncle Aribert!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Listen, Eugen, for God’s sake. I love Nella Racksole. I shall marry her.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You!’ There was a long pause, and then Eugen laughed. ‘Ah!’ he said.
      ‘They all talk like that to start with. I have talked like that myself,
      dear uncle; it sounds nice, and it means nothing.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In this case it means everything, Eugen,’ said Aribert quietly. Some
      accent of determination in the latter’s tone made Eugen rather more
      serious.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You can’t marry her,’ he said. ‘The Emperor won’t permit a morganatic
      marriage.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Emperor has nothing to do with the affair. I shall renounce my
      rights.
    </p>
<p>
      I shall become a plain citizen.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In which case you will have no fortune to speak of.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But my wife will have a fortune. Knowing the sacrifices which I shall
      have made in order to marry her, she will not hesitate to place that
      fortune in my hands for our mutual use,’ said Aribert stiffly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will decidedly be rich,’ mused Eugen, as his ideas dwelt on Theodore
      Racksole’s reputed wealth. ‘But have you thought of this,’ he asked, and
      his mild eyes glowed again in a sort of madness. ‘Have you thought that I
      am unmarried, and might die at any moment, and then the throne will
      descend to you—to you, Aribert?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The throne will never descend to me, Eugen,’ said Aribert softly, ‘for
      you will live. You are thoroughly convalescent. You have nothing to fear.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is the next seven days that I fear,’ said Eugen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The next seven days! Why?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not know. But I fear them. If I can survive them—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Sampson Levi, sire,’ Hans announced in a loud tone.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty MR SAMPSON LEVI BIDS PRINCE EUGEN GOOD MORNING
    </h2>
<p>
      PRINCE EUGEN started. ‘I will see him,’ he said, with a gesture to Hans as
      if to indicate that Mr Sampson Levi might enter at once.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I beg one moment first,’ said Aribert, laying a hand gently on his
      nephew’s arm, and giving old Hans a glance which had the effect of
      precipitating that admirably trained servant through the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is it?’ asked Prince Eugen crossly. ‘Why this sudden seriousness?
      Don’t forget that I have an appointment with Mr Sampson Levi, and must not
      keep him waiting. Someone said that punctuality is the politeness of
      princes.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Eugen,’ said Aribert, ‘I wish you to be as serious as I am. Why cannot we
      have faith in each other? I want to help you. I have helped you. You are
      my titular Sovereign; but on the other hand I have the honour to be your
      uncle:
    </p>
<p>
      I have the honour to be the same age as you, and to have been your
      companion from youth up. Give me your confidence. I thought you had given
      it me years ago, but I have lately discovered that you had your secrets,
      even then. And now, since your illness, you are still more secretive.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you mean, Aribert?’ said Eugen, in a tone which might have been
      either inimical or friendly. ‘What do you want to say?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, in the first place, I want to say that you will not succeed with
      the estimable Mr Sampson Levi.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Shall I not?’ said Eugen lightly. ‘How do you know what my business is
      with him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Suffice it to say that I know. You will never get that million pounds out
      of him.’
    </p>
<p>
      Prince Eugen gasped, and then swallowed his excitement. ‘Who has been
      talking? What million?’ His eyes wandered uneasily round the room. ‘Ah!’
      he said, pretending to laugh. ‘I see how it is. I have been chattering in
      my delirium. You mustn’t take any notice of that, Aribert. When one has a
      fever one’s ideas become grotesque and fanciful.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You never talked in your delirium,’ Aribert replied; ‘at least not about
      yourself. I knew about this projected loan before I saw you in Ostend.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who told you?’ demanded Eugen fiercely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you admit that you are trying to raise a loan?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I admit nothing. Who told you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Theodore Racksole, the millionaire. These rich men have no secrets from
      each other. They form a coterie, closer than any coterie of ours. Eugen,
      and far more powerful. They talk, and in talking they rule the world,
      these millionaires. They are the real monarchs.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Curse them!’ said Eugen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, perhaps so. But let me return to your case. Imagine my shame, my
      disgust, when I found that Racksole could tell me more about your affairs
      than I knew myself. Happily, he is a good fellow; one can trust him;
      otherwise I should have been tempted to do something desperate when I
      discovered that all your private history was in his hands. Eugen, let us
      come to the point; why do you want that million? Is it actually true that
      you are so deeply in debt? I have no desire to improve the occasion. I
      merely ask.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And what if I do owe a million?’ said Prince Eugen with assumed valour.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, nothing, my dear Eugen, nothing. Only it is rather a large sum to
      have scattered in ten years, is it not? How did you manage it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t ask me, Aribert. I’ve been a fool. But I swear to you that the
      woman whom you call “the lady in the red hat” is the last of my follies. I
      am about to take a wife, and become a respectable Prince.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then the engagement with Princess Anna is an accomplished fact?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Practically so. As soon as I have settled with Levi, all will be smooth.
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert, I wouldn’t lose Anna for the Imperial throne. She is a good and
      pure woman, and I love her as a man might love an angel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And yet you would deceive her as to your debts, Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not her, but her absurd parents, and perhaps the Emperor. They have heard
      rumours, and I must set those rumours at rest by presenting to them a
      clean sheet.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am glad you have been frank with me, Eugen,’ said Prince Aribert, ‘but
      I will be plain with you. You will never marry the Princess Anna.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And why?’ said Eugen, supercilious again.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because her parents will not permit it. Because you will not be able to
      present a clean sheet to them. Because this Sampson Levi will never lend
      you a million.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Explain yourself.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I propose to do so. You were kidnapped—it is a horrid word, but we
      must use it—in Ostend.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘True.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you know why?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose because that vile old red-hatted woman and her accomplices
      wanted to get some money out of me. Fortunately, thanks to you, they
      didn’t.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not at all,’ said Aribert. ‘They wanted no money from you. They knew well
      enough that you had no money. They knew you were the naughty schoolboy
      among European Princes, with no sense of responsibility or of duty towards
      your kingdom. Shall I tell you why they kidnapped you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘When you have done abusing me, my dear uncle.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘They kidnapped you merely to keep you out of England for a few days,
      merely to compel you to fail in your appointment with Sampson Levi. And it
      appears to me that they succeeded. Assuming that you don’t obtain the
      money from Levi, is there another financier in all Europe from whom you
      can get it—on such strange security as you have to offer?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Possibly there is not,’ said Prince Eugen calmly. ‘But, you see, I shall
      get it from Sampson Levi. Levi promised it, and I know from other sources
      that he is a man of his word. He said that the money, subject to certain
      formalities, would be available till—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Till?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Till the end of June.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And it is now the end of July.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, what is a month? He is only too glad to lend the money. He will get
      excellent interest. How on earth have you got into your sage old head this
      notion of a plot against me? The idea is ridiculous. A plot against me?
      What for?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have you ever thought of Bosnia?’ asked Aribert coldly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What of Bosnia?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I need not tell you that the King of Bosnia is naturally under
      obligations to Austria, to whom he owes his crown. Austria is anxious for
      him to make a good influential marriage.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, let him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He is going to. He is going to marry the Princess Anna.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not while I live. He made overtures there a year ago, and was rebuffed.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes; but he will make overtures again, and this time he will not be
      rebuffed. Oh, Eugen! can’t you see that this plot against you is being
      engineered by some persons who know all about your affairs, and whose
      desire is to prevent your marriage with Princess Anna? Only one man in
      Europe can have any motive for wishing to prevent your marriage with
      Princess Anna, and that is the man who means to marry her himself.’ Eugen
      went very pale.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then, Aribert, do you mean to convey to me that my detention in Ostend
      was contrived by the agents of the King of Bosnia?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With a view to stopping my negotiations with Sampson Levi, and so putting
      an end to the possibility of my marriage with Anna?’
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert nodded.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are a good friend to me, Aribert. You mean well. But you are
      mistaken.
    </p>
<p>
      You have been worrying about nothing.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have you forgotten about Reginald Dimmock?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I remember you said that he had died.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I said nothing of the sort. I said that he had been assassinated. That
      was part of it, my poor Eugen.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pooh!’ said Eugen. ‘I don’t believe he was assassinated. And as for
      Sampson Levi, I will bet you a thousand marks that he and I come to terms
      this morning, and that the million is in my hands before I leave London.’
      Aribert shook his head.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You seem to be pretty sure of Mr Levi’s character. Have you had much to
      do with him before?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ Eugen hesitated a second, ‘a little. What young man in my position
      hasn’t had something to do with Mr Sampson Levi at one time or another?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I haven’t,’ said Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You! You are a fossil.’ He rang a silver bell. ‘Hans! I will receive Mr
      Sampson Levi.’
    </p>
<p>
      Whereupon Aribert discreetly departed, and Prince Eugen sat down in the
      great velvet chair, and began to look at the papers which Hans had
      previously placed upon the table.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good morning, your Royal Highness,’ said Sampson Levi, bowing as he
      entered. ‘I trust your Royal Highness is well.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Moderately, thanks,’ returned the Prince.
    </p>
<p>
      In spite of the fact that he had had as much to do with people of Royal
      blood as any plain man in Europe, Sampson Levi had never yet learned how
      to be at ease with these exalted individuals during the first few minutes
      of an interview. Afterwards, he resumed command of himself and his
      faculties, but at the beginning he was invariably flustered, scarlet of
      face, and inclined to perspiration.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We will proceed to business at once,’ said Prince Eugen. ‘Will you take a
      seat, Mr Levi?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I thank your Royal Highness.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now as to that loan which we had already practically arranged—a
      million, I think it was,’ said the Prince airily.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A million,’ Levi acquiesced, toying with his enormous watch chain.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Everything is now in order. Here are the papers and I should like to
      finish the matter up at once.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Exactly, your Highness, but—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what? You months ago expressed the warmest satisfaction at the
      security, though I am quite prepared to admit that the security, is of
      rather an unusual nature. You also agreed to the rate of interest. It is
      not everyone, Mr Levi, who can lend out a million at 5-1/2 per cent. And
      in ten years the whole amount will be paid back. I—er—I
      believe I informed you that the fortune of Princess Anna, who is about to
      accept my hand, will ultimately amount to something like fifty millions of
      marks, which is over two million pounds in your English money.’ Prince
      Eugen stopped. He had no fancy for talking in this confidential manner to
      financiers, but he felt that circumstances demanded it.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You see, it’s like this, your Royal Highness,’ began Mr Sampson Levi, in
      his homely English idiom. ‘It’s like this. I said I could keep that bit of
      money available till the end of June, and you were to give me an interview
      here before that date. Not having heard from your Highness, and not
      knowing your Highness’s address, though my German agents made every
      inquiry, I concluded, that you had made other arrangements, money being so
      cheap this last few months.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I was unfortunately detained at Ostend,’ said Prince Eugen, with as much
      haughtiness as he could assume, ‘by—by important business. I have
      made no other arrangements, and I shall have need of the million. If you
      will be so good as to pay it to my London bankers—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m very sorry,’ said Mr Sampson Levi, with a tremendous and dazzling air
      of politeness, which surprised even himself, ‘but my syndicate has now
      lent the money elsewhere. It’s in South America—I don’t mind telling
      your Highness that we’ve lent it to the Chilean Government.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hang the Chilean Government, Mr Levi,’ exclaimed the Prince, and he went
      white. ‘I must have that million. It was an arrangement.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It was an arrangement, I admit,’ said Mr Sampson Levi, ‘but your Highness
      broke the arrangement.’
    </p>
<p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you mean to say,’ began the Prince with tense calmness, ‘that you are
      not in a position to let me have that million?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I could let your Highness have a million in a couple of years’ time.’
    </p>
<p>
      The Prince made a gesture of annoyance. ‘Mr Levi,’ he said, ‘if you do not
      place the money in my hands to-morrow you will ruin one of the oldest of
      reigning families, and, incidentally, you will alter the map of Europe.
      You are not keeping faith, and I had relied on you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Pardon me, your Highness,’ said little Levi, rising in resentment, ‘it is
      not I who have not kept faith. I beg to repeat that the money is no longer
      at my disposal, and to bid your Highness good morning.’
    </p>
<p>
      And Mr Sampson Levi left the audience chamber with an awkward, aggrieved
      bow. It was a scene characteristic of the end of the nineteenth century—an
      overfed, commonplace, pursy little man who had been born in a Brixton
      semi-detached villa, and whose highest idea of pleasure was a Sunday up
      the river in an expensive electric launch, confronting and utterly
      routing, in a hotel belonging to an American millionaire, the
      representative of a race of men who had fingered every page of European
      history for centuries, and who still, in their native castles, were
      surrounded with every outward circumstance of pomp and power.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aribert,’ said Prince Eugen, a little later, ‘you were right. It is all
      over. I have only one refuge—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You don’t mean—’ Aribert stopped, dumbfounded.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, I do,’ he said quickly. ‘I can manage it so that it will look like
      an accident.’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-One THE RETURN OF FÉLIX BABYLON
    </h2>
<p>
      ON the evening of Prince Eugen’s fateful interview with Mr Sampson Levi,
      Theodore Racksole was wandering somewhat aimlessly and uneasily about the
      entrance hall and adjacent corridors of the Grand Babylon. He had returned
      from Ostend only a day or two previously, and had endeavoured with all his
      might to forget the affair which had carried him there—to regard it,
      in fact, as done with. But he found himself unable to do so. In vain he
      remarked, under his breath, that there were some things which were best
      left alone: if his experience as a manipulator of markets, a contriver of
      gigantic schemes in New York, had taught him anything at all, it should
      surely have taught him that. Yet he could not feel reconciled to such a
      position. The mere presence of the princes in his hotel roused the
      fighting instincts of this man, who had never in his whole career been
      beaten. He had, as it were, taken up arms on their side, and if the
      princes of Posen would not continue their own battle, nevertheless he,
      Theodore Racksole, wanted to continue it for them. To a certain extent, of
      course, the battle had been won, for Prince Eugen had been rescued from an
      extremely difficult and dangerous position, and the enemy—consisting
      of Jules, Rocco, Miss Spencer, and perhaps others—had been put to
      flight. But that, he conceived, was not enough; it was very far from being
      enough. That the criminals, for criminals they decidedly were, should
      still be at large, he regarded as an absurd anomaly. And there was another
      point: he had said nothing to the police of all that had occurred. He
      disdained the police, but he could scarcely fail to perceive that if the
      police should by accident gain a clue to the real state of the case he
      might be placed rather awkwardly, for the simple reason that in the eyes
      of the law it amounted to a misdemeanour to conceal as much as he had
      concealed. He asked himself, for the thousandth time, why he had adopted a
      policy of concealment from the police, why he had become in any way
      interested in the Posen matter, and why, at this present moment, he should
      be so anxious to prosecute it further? To the first two questions he
      replied, rather lamely, that he had been influenced by Nella, and also by
      a natural spirit of adventure; to the third he replied that he had always
      been in the habit of carrying things through, and was now actuated by a
      mere childish, obstinate desire to carry this one through. Moreover, he
      was splendidly conscious of his perfect ability to carry it through. One
      additional impulse he had, though he did not admit it to himself, being by
      nature adverse to big words, and that was an abstract love of justice, the
      Anglo-Saxon’s deep-found instinct for helping the right side to conquer,
      even when grave risks must thereby be run, with no corresponding
      advantage.
    </p>
<p>
      He was turning these things over in his mind as he walked about the vast
      hotel on that evening of the last day in July. The Society papers had been
      stating for a week past that London was empty, but, in spite of the
      Society papers, London persisted in seeming to be just as full as ever.
      The Grand Babylon was certainly not as crowded as it had been a month
      earlier, but it was doing a very passable business. At the close of the
      season the gay butterflies of the social community have a habit of
      hovering for a day or two in the big hotels before they flutter away to
      castle and country-house, meadow and moor, lake and stream. The great
      basket-chairs in the portico were well filled by old and middle-aged
      gentlemen engaged in enjoying the varied delights of liqueurs, cigars, and
      the full moon which floated so serenely above the Thames. Here and there a
      pretty woman on the arm of a cavalier in immaculate attire swept her train
      as she turned to and fro in the promenade of the terrace. Waiters and
      uniformed commissionaires and gold-braided doorkeepers moved noiselessly
      about; at short intervals the chief of the doorkeepers blew his shrill
      whistle and hansoms drove up with tinkling bell to take away a pair of
      butterflies to some place of amusement or boredom; occasionally a private
      carriage drawn by expensive and self-conscious horses put the hansoms to
      shame by its mere outward glory. It was a hot night, a night for the
      summer woods, and save for the vehicles there was no rapid movement of any
      kind. It seemed as though the world—the world, that is to say, of
      the Grand Babylon—was fully engaged in the solemn processes of
      digestion and small-talk. Even the long row of the Embankment gas-lamps,
      stretching right and left, scarcely trembled in the still, warm, caressing
      air. The stars overhead looked down with many blinkings upon the enormous
      pile of the Grand Babylon, and the moon regarded it with bland and
      changeless face; what they thought of it and its inhabitants cannot,
      unfortunately, be recorded. What Theodore Racksole thought of the moon can
      be recorded: he thought it was a nuisance. It somehow fascinated his gaze
      with its silly stare, and so interfered with his complex meditations. He
      glanced round at the well-dressed and satisfied people—his guests,
      his customers. They appeared to ignore him absolutely.
    </p>
<p>
      Probably only a very small percentage of them had the least idea that this
      tall spare man, with the iron-grey hair and the thin, firm, resolute face,
      who wore his American-cut evening clothes with such careless ease, was the
      sole proprietor of the Grand Babylon, and possibly the richest man in
      Europe. As has already been stated, Racksole was not a celebrity in
      England.
    </p>
<p>
      The guests of the Grand Babylon saw merely a restless male person, whose
      restlessness was rather a disturber of their quietude, but with whom, to
      judge by his countenance, it would be inadvisable to remonstrate.
      Therefore Theodore Racksole continued his perambulations unchallenged, and
      kept saying to himself, ‘I must do something.’ But what? He could think of
      no course to pursue.
    </p>
<p>
      At last he walked straight through the hotel and out at the other
      entrance, and so up the little unassuming side street into the roaring
      torrent of the narrow and crowded Strand. He jumped on a Putney bus, and
      paid his fair to Putney, fivepence, and then, finding that the humble
      occupants of the vehicle stared at the spectacle of a man in evening dress
      but without a dustcoat, he jumped off again, oblivious of the fact that
      the conductor jerked a thumb towards him and winked at the passengers as
      who should say, ‘There goes a lunatic.’ He went into a tobacconist’s shop
      and asked for a cigar. The shopman mildly inquired what price.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What are the best you’ve got?’ asked Theodore Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Five shillings each, sir,’ said the man promptly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Give me a penny one,’ was Theodore Racksole’s laconic request, and he
      walked out of the shop smoking the penny cigar. It was a new sensation for
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      He was inhaling the aromatic odours of Eugène Rimmel’s establishment for
      the sale of scents when a gentleman, walking slowly in the opposite
      direction, accosted him with a quiet, ‘Good evening, Mr Racksole.’ The
      millionaire did not at first recognize his interlocutor, who wore a
      travelling overcoat, and was carrying a handbag. Then a slight, pleased
      smile passed over his features, and he held out his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, Mr Babylon,’ he greeted the other, ‘of all persons in the wide
      world you are the man I would most have wished to meet.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You flatter me,’ said the little Anglicized Swiss.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, I don’t,’ answered Racksole; ‘it isn’t my custom, any more than it’s
      yours. I wanted to have a real good long yarn with you, and lo! here you
      are! Where have you sprung from?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘From Lausanne,’ said Felix Babylon. ‘I had finished my duties there, I
      had nothing else to do, and I felt homesick. I felt the nostalgia of
      London, and so I came over, just as you see,’ and he raised the handbag
      for Racksole’s notice. ‘One toothbrush, one razor, two slippers, eh?’ He
      laughed. ‘I was wondering as I walked along where I should stay—me,
      Felix Babylon, homeless in London.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I should advise you to stay at the Grand Babylon,’ Racksole laughed back.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is a good hotel, and I know the proprietor personally.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Rather expensive, is it not?’ said Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To you, sir,’ answered Racksole, ‘the inclusive terms will be exactly
      half a crown a week. Do you accept?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I accept,’ said Babylon, and added, ‘You are very good, Mr Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      They strolled together back to the hotel, saying nothing in particular,
      but feeling very content with each other’s company.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Many customers?’ asked Felix Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Very tolerable,’ said Racksole, assuming as much of the air of the
      professional hotel proprietor as he could. ‘I think I may say in the
      storekeeper’s phrase, that if there is any business about I am doing it.
    </p>
<p>
      To-night the people are all on the terrace in the portico—it’s so
      confoundedly hot—and the consumption of ice is simply enormous—nearly
      as large as it would be in New York.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In that case,’ said Babylon politely, ‘let me offer you another cigar.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But I have not finished this one.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is just why I wish to offer you another one. A cigar such as yours,
      my good friend, ought never to be smoked within the precincts of the Grand
      Babylon, not even by the proprietor of the Grand Babylon, and especially
      when all the guests are assembled in the portico. The fumes of it would
      ruin any hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole laughingly lighted the Rothschild Havana which Babylon
      gave him, and they entered the hotel arm in arm. But no sooner had they
      mounted the steps than little Felix became the object of numberless
      greetings. It appeared that he had been highly popular among his quondam
      guests. At last they reached the managerial room, where Babylon was
      regaled on a chicken, and Racksole assisted him in the consumption of a
      bottle of Heidsieck Monopole, Carte d’Or.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This chicken is almost perfectly grilled,’ said Babylon at length. ‘It is
      a credit to the house. But why, my dear Racksole, why in the name of
      Heaven did you quarrel with Rocco?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you have heard?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Heard! My dear friend, it was in every newspaper on the Continent. Some
      journals prophesied that the Grand Babylon would have to close its doors
      within half a year now that Rocco had deserted it. But of course I knew
      better. I knew that you must have a good reason for allowing Rocco to
      depart, and that you must have made arrangements in advance for a
      substitute.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘As a matter of fact, I had not made arrangements in advance,’ said
      Theodore Racksole, a little ruefully; ‘but happily we have found in our
      second sous-chef an artist inferior only to Rocco himself. That, however,
      was mere good fortune.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Surely,’ said Babylon, ‘it was indiscreet to trust to mere good fortune
      in such a serious matter?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I didn’t trust to mere good fortune. I didn’t trust to anything except
      Rocco, and he deceived me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But why did you quarrel with him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I didn’t quarrel with him. I found him embalming a corpse in the State
      bedroom one night—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You what?’ Babylon almost screamed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I found him embalming a corpse in the State bedroom,’ repeated Racksole
      in his quietest tones.
    </p>
<p>
      The two men gazed at each other, and then Racksole replenished Babylon’s
      glass.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tell me,’ said Babylon, settling himself deep in an easy chair and
      lighting a cigar.
    </p>
<p>
      And Racksole thereupon recounted to him the whole of the Posen episode,
      with every circumstantial detail so far as he knew it. It was a long and
      complicated recital, and occupied about an hour. During that time little
      Felix never spoke a word, scarcely moved a muscle; only his small eyes
      gazed through the bluish haze of smoke. The clock on the mantelpiece
      tinkled midnight.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Time for whisky and soda,’ said Racksole, and got up as if to ring the
      bell; but Babylon waved him back.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have told me that this Sampson Levi had an audience of Prince Eugen
      to-day, but you have not told me the result of that audience,’ said
      Babylon.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because I do not yet know it. But I shall doubtless know to-morrow. In
      the meantime, I feel fairly sure that Levi declined to produce Prince
      Eugen’s required million. I have reason to believe that the money was lent
      elsewhere.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘H’m!’ mused Babylon; and then, carelessly, ‘I am not at all surprised at
      that arrangement for spying through the bathroom of the State apartments.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why are you not surprised?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh!’ said Babylon, ‘it is such an obvious dodge—so easy to carry
      out. As for me, I took special care never to involve myself in these
      affairs. I knew they existed; I somehow felt that they existed. But I also
      felt that they lay outside my sphere. My business was to provide board and
      lodging of the most sumptuous kind to those who didn’t mind paying for it;
      and I did my business. If anything else went on in the hotel, under the
      rose, I long determined to ignore it unless it should happen to be brought
      before my notice; and it never was brought before my notice. However, I
      admit that there is a certain pleasurable excitement in this kind of
      affair and doubtless you have experienced that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have,’ said Racksole simply, ‘though I believe you are laughing at me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘By no means,’ Babylon replied. ‘Now what, if I may ask the question, is
      going to be your next step?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is just what I desire to know myself,’ said Theodore Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said Babylon, after a pause, ‘let us begin. In the first place, it
      is possible you may be interested to hear that I happened to see Jules
      to-day.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You did!’ Racksole remarked with much calmness. ‘Where?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, it was early this morning, in Paris, just before I left there. The
      meeting was quite accidental, and Jules seemed rather surprised at meeting
      me. He respectfully inquired where I was going, and I said that I was
      going to Switzerland. At that moment I thought I was going to Switzerland.
      It had occurred to me that after all I should be happier there, and that I
      had better turn back and not see London any more. However, I changed my
      mind once again, and decided to come on to London, and accept the risks of
      being miserable there without my hotel. Then I asked Jules whither he was
      bound, and he told me that he was off to Constantinople, being interested
      in a new French hotel there. I wished him good luck, and we parted.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Constantinople, eh!’ said Racksole. ‘A highly suitable place for him, I
      should say.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But,’ Babylon resumed, ‘I caught sight of him again.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘At Charing Cross, a few minutes before I had the pleasure of meeting you.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr Jules had not gone to Constantinople after all. He did not see me, or I
      should have suggested to him that in going from Paris to Constantinople it
      is not usual to travel via London.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The cheek of the fellow!’ exclaimed Theodore Racksole. ‘The gorgeous and
      colossal cheek of the fellow!’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Two IN THE WINE CELLARS OF THE GRAND BABYLON
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘DO you know anything of the antecedents of this Jules,’ asked Theodore
      Racksole, helping himself to whisky.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing whatever,’ said Babylon. ‘Until you told me, I don’t think I was
      aware that his true name was Thomas Jackson, though of course I knew that
      it was not Jules. I certainly was not aware that Miss Spencer was his
      wife, but I had long suspected that their relations were somewhat more
      intimate than the nature of their respective duties in the hotel
      absolutely demanded. All that I do know of Jules—he will always be
      called Jules—is that he gradually, by some mysterious personal
      force, acquired a prominent position in the hotel. Decidedly he was the
      cleverest and most intellectual waiter I have ever known, and he was
      specially skilled in the difficult task of retaining his own dignity while
      not interfering with that of other people.
    </p>
<p>
      I’m afraid this information is a little too vague to be of any practical
      assistance in the present difficulty.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is the present difficulty?’ Racksole queried, with a simple air.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I should imagine that the present difficulty is to account for the man’s
      presence in London.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is easily accounted for,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How? Do you suppose he is anxious to give himself up to justice, or that
      the chains of habit bind him to the hotel?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Neither,’ said Racksole. ‘Jules is going to have another try—that’s
      all.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Another try at what?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘At Prince Eugen. Either at his life or his liberty. Most probably the
      former this time; almost certainly the former. He has guessed that we are
      somewhat handicapped by our anxiety to keep Prince Eugen’s predicament
      quite quiet, and he is taking advantage, of that fact. As he already is
      fairly rich, on his own admission, the reward which has been offered to
      him must be enormous, and he is absolutely determined to get it. He has
      several times recently proved himself to be a daring fellow; unless I am
      mistaken he will shortly prove himself to be still more daring.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what can he do? Surely you don’t suggest that he will attempt the
      life of Prince Eugen in this hotel?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not? If Reginald Dimmock fell on mere suspicion that he would turn
      out unfaithful to the conspiracy, why not Prince Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But it would be an unspeakable crime, and do infinite harm to the hotel!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘True!’ Racksole admitted, smiling. Little Felix Babylon seemed to brace
      himself for the grasping of his monstrous idea.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How could it possibly be done?’ he asked at length.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dimmock was poisoned.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, but you had Rocco here then, and Rocco was in the plot. It is
      conceivable that Rocco could have managed it—barely conceivable. But
      without Rocco I cannot think it possible. I cannot even think that Jules
      would attempt it. You see, in a place like the Grand Babylon, as probably
      I needn’t point out to you, food has to pass through so many hands that to
      poison one person without killing perhaps fifty would be a most delicate
      operation. Moreover, Prince Eugen, unless he has changed his habits, is
      always served by his own attendant, old Hans, and therefore any attempt to
      tamper with a cooked dish immediately before serving would be hazardous in
      the extreme.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Granted,’ said Racksole. ‘The wine, however, might be more easily got at.
    </p>
<p>
      Had you thought of that?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had not,’ Babylon admitted. ‘You are an ingenious theorist, but I
      happen to know that Prince Eugen always has his wine opened in his own
      presence. No doubt it would be opened by Hans. Therefore the wine theory
      is not tenable, my friend.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I do not see why,’ said Racksole. ‘I know nothing of wine as an expert,
      and I very seldom drink it, but it seems to me that a bottle of wine might
      be tampered with while it was still in the cellar, especially if there was
      an accomplice in the hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You think, then, that you are not yet rid of all your conspirators?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think that Jules might still have an accomplice within the building.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And that a bottle of wine could be opened and recorked without leaving
      any trace of the operation?’ Babylon was a trifle sarcastic.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t see the necessity of opening the bottle in order to poison the
      wine,’ said Racksole. ‘I have never tried to poison anybody by means of a
      bottle of wine, and I don’t lay claim to any natural talent as a poisoner,
      but I think I could devise several ways of managing the trick. Of course,
      I admit I may be entirely mistaken as to Jules’ intentions.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said Felix Babylon. ‘The wine cellars beneath us are one of the
      wonders of London. I hope you are aware, Mr Racksole, that when you bought
      the Grand Babylon you bought what is probably the finest stock of wines in
      England, if not in Europe. In the valuation I reckoned them at sixty
      thousand pounds. And I may say that I always took care that the cellars
      were properly guarded. Even Jules would experience a serious difficulty in
      breaking into the cellars without the connivance of the wine-clerk, and
      the wine-clerk is, or was, incorruptible.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am ashamed to say that I have not yet inspected my wines,’ smiled
      Racksole; ‘I have never given them a thought. Once or twice I have taken
      the trouble to make a tour of the hotel, but I omitted the cellars in my
      excursions.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Impossible, my dear fellow!’ said Babylon, amused at such a confession,
      to him—a great connoisseur and lover of fine wines—almost
      incredible. ‘But really you must see them to-morrow. If I may, I will
      accompany you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why not to-night?’ Racksole suggested, calmly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To-night! It is very late: Hubbard will have gone to bed.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And may I ask who is Hubbard? I remember the name but dimly.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hubbard is the wine-clerk of the Grand Babylon,’ said Felix, with a
      certain emphasis. ‘A sedate man of forty. He has the keys of the cellars.
      He knows every bottle of every bin, its date, its qualities, its value.
      And he’s a teetotaler. Hubbard is a curiosity. No wine can leave the
      cellars without his knowledge, and no person can enter the cellars without
      his knowledge. At least, that is how it was in my time,’ Babylon added.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We will wake him,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But it is one o’clock in the morning,’ Babylon protested.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never mind—that is, if you consent to accompany me. A cellar is the
      same by night as by day. Therefore, why not now?’
    </p>
<p>
      Babylon shrugged his shoulders. ‘As you wish,’ he agreed, with his
      indestructible politeness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now to find this Mr Hubbard, with his key of the cupboard,’ said
      Racksole, as they walked out of the room together. Although the hour was
      so late, the hotel was not, of course, closed for the night. A few guests
      still remained about in the public rooms, and a few fatigued waiters were
      still in attendance. One of these latter was despatched in search of the
      singular Mr Hubbard, and it fortunately turned out that this gentleman had
      not actually retired, though he was on the point of doing so. He brought
      the keys to Mr Racksole in person, and after he had had a little chat with
      his former master, the proprietor and the ex-proprietor of the Grand
      Babylon HÃ´tel proceeded on their way to the cellars.
    </p>
<p>
      These cellars extend over, or rather under, quite half the superficial
      areas of the whole hotel—the longitudinal half which lies next to
      the Strand.
    </p>
<p>
      Owing to the fact that the ground slopes sharply from the Strand to the
      river, the Grand Babylon is, so to speak, deeper near the Strand than it
      is near the Thames. Towards the Thames there is, below the entrance level,
      a basement and a sub-basement. Towards the Strand there is basement,
      sub-basement, and the huge wine cellars beneath all. After descending the
      four flights of the service stairs, and traversing a long passage running
      parallel with the kitchen, the two found themselves opposite a door,
      which, on being unlocked, gave access to another flight of stairs. At the
      foot of this was the main entrance to the cellars. Outside the entrance
      was the wine-lift, for the ascension of delicious fluids to the upper
      floors, and, opposite, Mr Hubbard’s little office. There was electric
      light everywhere.
    </p>
<p>
      Babylon, who, as being most accustomed to them, held the bunch of keys,
      opened the great door, and then they were in the first cellar—the
      first of a suite of five. Racksole was struck not only by the icy coolness
      of the place, but also by its vastness. Babylon had seized a portable
      electric handlight, attached to a long wire, which lay handy, and, waving
      it about, disclosed the dimensions of the place. By that flashing
      illumination the subterranean chamber looked unutterably weird and
      mysterious, with its rows of numbered bins, stretching away into the
      distance till the radiance was reduced to the occasional far gleam of the
      light on the shoulder of a bottle. Then Babylon switched on the fixed
      electric lights, and Theodore Racksole entered upon a personally-conducted
      tour of what was quite the most interesting part of his own property.
    </p>
<p>
      To see the innocent enthusiasm of Felix Babylon for these stores of
      exhilarating liquid was what is called in the North ‘a sight for sair
      een’.
    </p>
<p>
      He displayed to Racksole’s bewildered gaze, in their due order, all the
      wines of three continents—nay, of four, for the superb and luscious
      Constantia wine of Cape Colony was not wanting in that most catholic
      collection of vintages. Beginning with the unsurpassed products of
      Burgundy, he continued with the clarets of Médoc, Bordeaux, and Sauterne;
      then to the champagnes of Ay, Hautvilliers, and Pierry; then to the hocks
      and moselles of Germany, and the brilliant imitation champagnes of Main,
      Neckar, and Naumburg; then to the famous and adorable Tokay of Hungary,
      and all the Austrian varieties of French wines, including Carlowitz and
      Somlauer; then to the dry sherries of Spain, including purest Manzanilla,
      and Amontillado, and Vino de Pasto; then to the wines of Malaga, both
      sweet and dry, and all the ‘Spanish reds’ from Catalonia, including the
      dark ‘Tent’ so often used sacramentally; then to the renowned port of
      Oporto. Then he proceeded to the Italian cellar, and descanted upon the
      excellence of Barolo from Piedmont, of Chianti from Tuscany, of Orvieto
      from the Roman States, of the ‘Tears of Christ’ from Naples, and the
      commoner Marsala from Sicily. And so on, to an extent and with a fullness
      of detail which cannot be rendered here.
    </p>
<p>
      At the end of the suite of cellars there was a glazed door, which, as
      could be seen, gave access to a supplemental and smaller cellar, an
      apartment about fifteen or sixteen feet square.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Anything special in there?’ asked Racksole curiously, as they stood
      before the door, and looked within at the seined ends of bottles.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ exclaimed Babylon, almost smacking his lips, ‘therein lies the cream
      of all.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The best champagne, I suppose?’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ said Babylon, ‘the best champagne is there—a very special
      Sillery, as exquisite as you will find anywhere. But I see, my friend,
      that you fall into the common error of putting champagne first among
      wines. That distinction belongs to Burgundy. You have old Burgundy in that
      cellar, Mr Racksole, which cost me—how much do you think?—eighty
      pounds a bottle.
    </p>
<p>
      Probably it will never be drunk,’ he added with a sigh. ‘It is too
      expensive even for princes and plutocrats.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, it will,’ said Racksole quickly. ‘You and I will have a bottle up
      to-morrow.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then,’ continued Babylon, still riding his hobby-horse, ‘there is a
      sample of the Rhine wine dated 1706 which caused such a sensation at the
      Vienna Exhibition of 1873. There is also a singularly glorious Persian
      wine from Shiraz, the like of which I have never seen elsewhere. Also
      there is an unrivalled vintage of Romanée-Conti, greatest of all modern
      Burgundies. If I remember right Prince Eugen invariably has a bottle when
      he comes to stay here. It is not on the hotel wine list, of course, and
      only a few customers know of it. We do not precisely hawk it about the
      dining-room.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Indeed!’ said Racksole. ‘Let us go inside.’
    </p>
<p>
      They entered the stone apartment, rendered almost sacred by the
      preciousness of its contents, and Racksole looked round with a strangely
      intent and curious air. At the far side was a grating, through which came
      a feeble light.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is that?’ asked the millionaire sharply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is merely a ventilation grating. Good ventilation is absolutely
      essential.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Looks broken, doesn’t it?’ Racksole suggested and then, putting a finger
      quickly on Babylon’s shoulder, ‘there’s someone in the cellar. Can’t you
      hear breathing, down there, behind that bin?’
    </p>
<p>
      The two men stood tense and silent for a while, listening, under the ray
      of the single electric light in the ceiling. Half the cellar was involved
      in gloom. At length Racksole walked firmly down the central passage-way
      between the bins and turned to the corner at the right.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come out, you villain!’ he said in a low, well-nigh vicious tone, and
      dragged up a cowering figure.
    </p>
<p>
      He had expected to find a man, but it was his own daughter, Nella
      Racksole, upon whom he had laid angry hands.
    </p>

      Chapter Twenty-Three FURTHER EVENTS IN THE CELLAR
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘WELL, Father,’ Nella greeted her astounded parent. ‘You should make sure
      that you have got hold of the right person before you use all that
      terrible muscular force of yours. I do believe you have broken my shoulder
      bone.’ She rubbed her shoulder with a comical expression of pain, and then
      stood up before the two men. The skirt of her dark grey dress was torn and
      dirty, and the usually trim Nella looked as though she had been shot down
      a canvas fire-escape. Mechanically she smoothed her frock, and gave a
      straightening touch to her hair.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good evening, Miss Racksole,’ said Felix Babylon, bowing formally. ‘This
      is an unexpected pleasure.’ Felix’s drawing-room manners never deserted
      him upon any occasion whatever.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May I inquire what you are doing in my wine cellar, Nella Racksole?’ said
      the millionaire a little stiffly He was certainly somewhat annoyed at
      having mistaken his daughter for a criminal; moreover, he hated to be
      surprised, and upon this occasion he had been surprised beyond any
      ordinary surprise; lastly, he was not at all pleased that Nella should be
      observed in that strange predicament by a stranger.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I will tell you,’ said Nella. ‘I had been reading rather late in my room—the
      night was so close. I heard Big Ben strike half-past twelve, and then I
      put the book down, and went out on to the balcony of my window for a
      little fresh air before going to bed. I leaned over the balcony very
      quietly—you will remember that I am on the third floor now—and
      looked down below into the little sunk yard which separates the wall of
      the hotel from Salisbury Lane. I was rather astonished to see a figure
      creeping across the yard. I knew there was no entrance into the hotel from
      that yard, and besides, it is fifteen or twenty feet below the level of
      the street. So I watched. The figure went close up against the wall, and
      disappeared from my view. I leaned over the balcony as far as I dared, but
      I couldn’t see him. I could hear him, however.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What could you hear?’ questioned Racksole sharply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It sounded like a sawing noise,’ said Nella; ‘and it went on for quite a
      long time—nearly a quarter of an hour, I should think—a
      rasping sort of noise.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why on earth didn’t you come and warn me or someone else in the hotel?’
      asked Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh, I don’t know, Dad,’ she replied sweetly. ‘I had got interested in it,
      and I thought I would see it out myself. Well, as I was saying, Mr.
      Babylon,’ she continued, addressing her remarks to Felix, with a dazzling
      smile, ‘that noise went on for quite a long time. At last it stopped, and
      the figure reappeared from under the wall, crossed the yard, climbed up
      the opposite wall by some means or other, and so over the railings into
      Salisbury Lane. I felt rather relieved then, because I knew he hadn’t
      actually broken into the hotel. He walked down Salisbury Lane very slowly.
      A policeman was just coming up. “Goodnight, officer,” I heard him say to
      the policeman, and he asked him for a match. The policeman supplied the
      match, and the other man lighted a cigarette, and proceeded further down
      the lane. By cricking your neck from my window, Mr Babylon, you can get a
      glimpse of the Embankment and the river. I saw the man cross the
      Embankment, and lean over the river wall, where he seemed to be talking to
      some one. He then walked along the Embankment to Westminster and that was
      the last I saw of him. I waited a minute or two for him to come back, but
      he didn’t come back, and so I thought it was about time I began to make
      inquiries into the affair. I went downstairs instantly, and out of the
      hotel, through the quadrangle, into Salisbury Lane, and I looked over
      those railings. There was a ladder on the other side, by which it was
      perfectly easy—once you had got over the railings—to climb
      down into the yard. I was horribly afraid lest someone might walk up
      Salisbury Lane and catch me in the act of negotiating those railings, but
      no one did, and I surmounted them, with no worse damage than a torn skirt.
      I crossed the yard on tiptoe, and I found that in the wall, close to the
      ground and almost exactly under my window, there was an iron grating,
      about one foot by fourteen inches. I suspected, as there was no other
      ironwork near, that the mysterious visitor must have been sawing at this
      grating for private purposes of his own. I gave it a good shake, and I was
      not at all surprised that a good part of it came off in my hand, leaving
      just enough room for a person to creep through. I decided that I would
      creep through, and now wish I hadn’t. I don’t know, Mr Babylon, whether
      you have ever tried to creep through a small hole with a skirt on. Have
      you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have not had that pleasure,’ said little Felix, bowing again, and
      absently taking up a bottle which lay to his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, you are fortunate,’ the imperturbable Nella resumed. ‘For quite
      three minutes I thought I should perish in that grating, Dad, with my
      shoulder inside and the rest of me outside. However, at last, by the most
      amazing and agonizing efforts, I pulled myself through and fell into this
      extraordinary cellar more dead than alive. Then I wondered what I should
      do next. Should I wait for the mysterious visitor to return, and stab him
      with my pocket scissors if he tried to enter, or should I raise an alarm?
      First of all I replaced the broken grating, then I struck a match, and I
      saw that I had got landed in a wilderness of bottles. The match went out,
      and I hadn’t another one. So I sat down in the corner to think. I had just
      decided to wait and see if the visitor returned, when I heard footsteps,
      and then voices; and then you came in. I must say I was rather taken
      aback, especially as I recognized the voice of Mr Babylon. You see, I
      didn’t want to frighten you.
    </p>
<p>
      If I had bobbed up from behind the bottles and said “Booh!” you would have
      had a serious shock. I wanted to think of a way of breaking my presence
      gently to you. But you saved me the trouble, Dad. Was I really breathing
      so loudly that you could hear me?’
    </p>
<p>
      The girl ended her strange recital, and there was a moment’s silence in
      the cellar. Racksole merely nodded an affirmative to her concluding
      question.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, Nell, my girl,’ said the millionaire at length, ‘we are much
      obliged for your gymnastic efforts—very much obliged. But now, I
      think you had better go off to bed. There is going to be some serious
      trouble here, I’ll lay my last dollar on that?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But if there is to be a burglary I should so like to see it, Dad,’ Nella
      pleaded. ‘I’ve never seen a burglar caught red-handed.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This isn’t a burglary, my dear. I calculate it’s something far worse than
      a burglary.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What?’ she cried. ‘Murder? Arson? Dynamite plot? How perfectly splendid!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Babylon informs me that Jules is in London,’ said Racksole quietly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Jules!’ she exclaimed under her breath, and her tone changed instantly to
      the utmost seriousness. ‘Switch off the light, quick!’ Springing to the
      switch, she put the cellar in darkness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What’s that for?’ said her father.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If he comes back he would see the light, and be frightened away,’ said
      Nella. ‘That wouldn’t do at all.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It wouldn’t, Miss Racksole,’ said Babylon, and there was in his voice a
      note of admiration for the girl’s sagacity which Racksole heard with high
      paternal pride.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Listen, Nella,’ said the latter, drawing his daughter to him in the
      profound gloom of the cellar. ‘We fancy that Jules may be trying to tamper
      with a certain bottle of wine—a bottle which might possibly be drunk
      by Prince Eugen. Now do you think that the man you saw might have been
      Jules?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I hadn’t previously thought of him as being Jules, but immediately you
      mentioned the name I somehow knew that he was. Yes, I am sure it was
      Jules.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, just hear what I have to say. There is no time to lose. If he is
      coming at all he will be here very soon—and you can help.’ Racksole
      explained what he thought Jules’ tactics might be. He proposed that if the
      man returned he should not be interfered with, but merely watched from the
      other side of the glass door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You want, as it were, to catch Mr Jules alive?’ said Babylon, who seemed
      rather taken aback at this novel method of dealing with criminals.
      ‘Surely,’ he added, ‘it would be simpler and easier to inform the police
      of your suspicion, and to leave everything to them.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My dear fellow,’ said Racksole, ‘we have already gone much too far
      without the police to make it advisable for us to call them in at this
      somewhat advanced stage of the proceedings. Besides, if you must know it,
      I have a particular desire to capture the scoundrel myself. I will leave
      you and Nella here, since Nella insists on seeing everything, and I will
      arrange things so that once he has entered the cellar Jules will not get
      out of it again—at any rate through the grating. You had better
      place yourselves on the other side of the glass door, in the big cellar;
      you will be in a position to observe from there, I will skip off at once.
      All you have to do is to take note of what the fellow does. If he has any
      accomplices within the hotel we shall probably be able by that means to
      discover who the accomplice is.’
    </p>
<p>
      Lighting a match and shading it with his hands, Racksole showed them both
      out of the little cellar. ‘Now if you lock this glass door on the outside
      he can’t escape this way: the panes of glass are too small, and the
      woodwork too stout. So, if he comes into the trap, you two will have the
      pleasure of actually seeing him frantically writhe therein, without any
      personal danger; but perhaps you’d better not show yourselves.’
    </p>
<p>
      In another moment Felix Babylon and Nella were left to themselves in the
      darkness of the cellar, listening to the receding footfalls of Theodore
      Racksole. But the sound of these footfalls had not died away before
      another sound greeted their ears—the grating of the small cellar was
      being removed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I hope your father will be in time,’ whispered Felix
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hush!’ the girl warned him, and they stooped side by side in tense
      silence.
    </p>
<p>
      A man cautiously but very neatly wormed his body through the aperture of
      the grating. The watchers could only see his form indistinctly in the
      darkness.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, being fairly within the cellar, he walked without the least
      hesitation to the electric switch and turned on the light. It was
      unmistakably Jules, and he knew the geography of the cellar very well.
      Babylon could with difficulty repress a start as he saw this bold and
      unscrupulous ex-waiter moving with such an air of assurance and
      determination about the precious cellar. Jules went directly to a small
      bin which was numbered 17, and took there from the topmost bottle.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Romanee-Conti—Prince Eugen’s wine!’ Babylon exclaimed under his
      breath.
    </p>
<p>
      Jules neatly and quickly removed the seal with an instrument which he had
      clearly brought for the purpose. He then took a little flat box from his
      pocket, which seemed to contain a sort of black salve. Rubbing his finger
      in this, he smeared the top of the neck of the bottle with it, just where
      the cork came against the glass. In another instant he had deftly replaced
      the seal and restored the bottle to its position. He then turned off the
      light, and made for the aperture. When he was half-way through Nella
      exclaimed, ‘He will escape, after all. Dad has not had time—we must
      stop him.’
    </p>
<p>
      But Babylon, that embodiment of caution, forcibly, but nevertheless
      politely, restrained this Yankee girl, whom he deemed so rash and
      imprudent, and before she could free herself the lithe form of Jules had
      disappeared.

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Four THE BOTTLE OF WINE
    </h2>
<p>
      AS regards Theodore Racksole, who was to have caught his man from the
      outside of the cellar, he made his way as rapidly as possible from the
      wine-cellars, up to the ground floor, out of the hotel by the quadrangle,
      through the quadrangle, and out into the top of Salisbury Lane. Now, owing
      to the vastness of the structure of the Grand Babylon, the mere distance
      thus to be traversed amounted to a little short of a quarter of a mile,
      and, as it included a number of stairs, about two dozen turnings, and
      several passages which at that time of night were in darkness more or less
      complete, Racksole could not have been expected to accomplish the journey
      in less than five minutes. As a matter of fact, six minutes had elapsed
      before he reached the top of Salisbury Lane, because he had been delayed
      nearly a minute by some questions addressed to him by a muddled and
      whisky-laden guest who had got lost in the corridors. As everybody knows,
      there is a sharp short bend in Salisbury Lane near the top. Racksole ran
      round this at good racing speed, but he was unfortunate enough to run
      straight up against the very policeman who had not long before so
      courteously supplied Jules with a match. The policeman seemed to be
      scarcely in so pliant a mood just then.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hullo!’ he said, his naturally suspicious nature being doubtless aroused
      by the spectacle of a bareheaded man in evening dress running violently
      down the lane. ‘What’s this? Where are you for in such a hurry?’ and he
      forcibly detained Theodore Racksole for a moment and scrutinized his face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, officer,’ said Racksole quietly, ‘none of your larks, if you please.
    </p>
<p>
      I’ve no time to lose.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ the policeman remarked, though hesitatingly and
      not quite with good temper, and Racksole was allowed to proceed on his
      way. The millionaire’s scheme for trapping Jules was to get down into the
      little sunk yard by means of the ladder, and then to secrete himself
      behind some convenient abutment of brickwork until Mr Tom Jackson should
      have got into the cellar. He therefore nimbly surmounted the railings—the
      railings of his own hotel—and was gingerly descending the ladder,
      when lo! a rough hand seized him by the coat-collar and with a ferocious
      jerk urged him backwards. The fact was, Theodore Racksole had counted
      without the policeman. That guardian of the peace, mistrusting Racksole’s
      manner, quietly followed him down the lane. The sight of the millionaire
      climbing the railings had put him on his mettle, and the result was the
      ignominious capture of Racksole. In vain Theodore expostulated, explained,
      anathematized. Only one thing would satisfy the stolid policeman—namely,
      that Racksole should return with him to the hotel and there establish his
      identity. If Racksole then proved to be Racksole, owner of the Grand
      Babylon, well and good—the policeman promised to apologize. So
      Theodore had no alternative but to accept the suggestion. To prove his
      identity was, of course, the work of only a few minutes, after which
      Racksole, annoyed, but cool as ever, returned to his railings, while the
      policeman went off to another part of his beat, where he would be likely
      to meet a comrade and have a chat.
    </p>
<p>
      In the meantime, our friend Jules, sublimely unconscious of the
      altercation going on outside, and of the special risk which he ran, was of
      course actually in the cellar, which he had reached before Racksole got to
      the railings for the first time. It was, indeed, a happy chance for Jules
      that his exit from the cellar coincided with the period during which
      Racksole was absent from the railings. As Racksole came down the lane for
      the second time, he saw a figure walking about fifty yards in front of him
      towards the Embankment. Instantly he divined that it was Jules, and that
      the policeman had thrown him just too late. He ran, and Jules, hearing the
      noise of pursuit, ran also. The ex-waiter was fleet; he made direct for a
      certain spot in the Embankment wall, and, to the intense astonishment of
      Racksole, jumped clean over the wall, as it seemed, into the river. ‘Is he
      so desperate as to commit suicide?’ Racksole exclaimed as he ran, but a
      second later the puff and snort of a steam launch told him that Jules was
      not quite driven to suicide. As the millionaire crossed the Embankment
      roadway he saw the funnel of the launch move out from under the
      river-wall. It swerved into midstream and headed towards London Bridge.
      There was a silent mist over the river. Racksole was helpless....
    </p>
<p>
      Although Racksole had now been twice worsted in a contest of wits within
      the precincts of the Grand Babylon, once by Rocco and once by Jules, he
      could not fairly blame himself for the present miscarriage of his plans—a
      miscarriage due to the meddlesomeness of an extraneous person, combined
      with pure ill-fortune. He did not, therefore, permit the accident to
      interfere with his sleep that night.
    </p>
<p>
      On the following day he sought out Prince Aribert, between whom and
      himself there now existed a feeling of unmistakable, frank friendship, and
      disclosed to him the happenings of the previous night, and particularly
      the tampering with the bottle of Romanée-Conti.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I believe you dined with Prince Eugen last night?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I did. And curiously enough we had a bottle of Romanée-Conti, an
      admirable wine, of which Eugen is passionately fond.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you will dine with him to-night?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Most probably. To-day will, I fear, be our last day here. Eugen wishes to
      return to Posen early to-morrow.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Has it struck you, Prince,’ said Racksole, ‘that if Jules had succeeded
      in poisoning your nephew, he would probably have succeeded also in
      poisoning you?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had not thought of it,’ laughed Aribert, ‘but it would seem so. It
      appears that so long as he brings down his particular quarry, Jules is
      careless of anything else that may be accidentally involved in the
      destruction. However, we need have no fear on that score now. You know the
      bottle, and you can destroy it at once.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But I do not propose to destroy it,’ said Racksole calmly. ‘If Prince
      Eugen asks for Romanée-Conti to be served to-night, as he probably will, I
      propose that that precise bottle shall be served to him—and to you.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you would poison us in spite of ourselves?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Scarcely,’ Racksole smiled. ‘My notion is to discover the accomplices
      within the hotel. I have already inquired as to the wine-clerk, Hubbard.
      Now does it not occur to you as extraordinary that on this particular day
      Mr Hubbard should be ill in bed? Hubbard, I am informed, is suffering from
      an attack of stomach poisoning, which has supervened during the night. He
      says that he does not know what can have caused it. His place in the wine
      cellars will be taken to-day by his assistant, a mere youth, but to all
      appearances a fairly smart youth. I need not say that we shall keep an eye
      on that youth.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘One moment,’ Prince Aribert interrupted. ‘I do not quite understand how
      you think the poisoning was to have been effected.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The bottle is now under examination by an expert, who has instructions to
      remove as little as possible of the stuff which Jules put on the rim of
      the mouth of it. It will be secretly replaced in its bin during the day.
      My idea is that by the mere action of pouring out the wine takes up some
      of the poison, which I deem to be very strong, and thus becomes fatal as
      it enters the glass.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But surely the servant in attendance would wipe the mouth of the bottle?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Very carelessly, perhaps. And moreover he would be extremely unlikely to
      wipe off all the stuff; some of it has been ingeniously placed just on the
      inside edge of the rim. Besides, suppose he forgot to wipe the bottle?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Prince Eugen is always served at dinner by Hans. It is an honour which
      the faithful old fellow reserves for himself.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But suppose Hans—’ Racksole stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hans an accomplice! My dear Racksole, the suggestion is wildly
      impossible.’
    </p>
<p>
      That night Prince Aribert dined with his august nephew in the superb
      dining-room of the Royal apartments. Hans served, the dishes being brought
      to the door by other servants. Aribert found his nephew despondent and
      taciturn. On the previous day, when, after the futile interview with
      Sampson Levi, Prince Eugen had despairingly threatened to commit suicide,
      in such a manner as to make it ‘look like an accident’, Aribert had
      compelled him to give his word of honour not to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What wine will your Royal Highness take?’ asked old Hans in his soothing
      tones, when the soup was served.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Sherry,’ was Prince Eugen’s curt order.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And Romanée-Conti afterwards?’ said Hans. Aribert looked up quickly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No, not to-night. I’ll try Sillery to-night,’ said Prince Eugen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think I’ll have Romanée-Conti, Hans, after all,’ he said. ‘It suits me
      better than champagne.’
    </p>
<p>
      The famous and unsurpassable Burgundy was served with the roast. Old Hans
      brought it tenderly in its wicker cradle, inserted the corkscrew with
      mathematical precision, and drew the cork, which he offered for his
      master’s inspection. Eugen nodded, and told him to put it down. Aribert
      watched with intense interest. He could not for an instant believe that
      Hans was not the very soul of fidelity, and yet, despite himself,
      Racksole’s words had caused him a certain uneasiness. At that moment
      Prince Eugen murmured across the table:
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aribert, I withdraw my promise. Observe that, I withdraw it.’ Aribert
      shook his head emphatically, without removing his gaze from Hans. The
      white-haired servant perfunctorily dusted his napkin round the neck of the
      bottle of Romanée-Conti, and poured out a glass. Aribert trembled from
      head to foot.
    </p>
<p>
      Eugen took up the glass and held it to the light.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t drink it,’ said Aribert very quietly. ‘It is poisoned.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poisoned!’ exclaimed Prince Eugen.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Poisoned, sire!’ exclaimed old Hans, with an air of profound amazement
      and concern, and he seized the glass. ‘Impossible, sire. I myself opened
      the bottle. No one else has touched it, and the cork was perfect.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I tell you it is poisoned,’ Aribert repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your Highness will pardon an old man,’ said Hans, ‘but to say that this
      wine is poison is to say that I am a murderer. I will prove to you that it
      is not poisoned. I will drink it.’ And he raised the glass to his
      trembling lips. In that moment Aribert saw that old Hans, at any rate, was
      not an accomplice of Jules. Springing up from his seat, he knocked the
      glass from the aged servitor’s hands, and the fragments of it fell with a
      light tinkling crash partly on the table and partly on the floor. The
      Prince and the servant gazed at one another in a distressing and terrible
      silence.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a slight noise, and Aribert looked aside. He saw that Eugen’s
      body had slipped forward limply over the left arm of his chair; the
      Prince’s arms hung straight and lifeless; his eyes were closed; he was
      unconscious.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Hans!’ murmured Aribert. ‘Hans! What is this?’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Five THE STEAM LAUNCH
    </h2>
<p>
      MR TOM JACKSON’s notion of making good his escape from the hotel by means
      of a steam launch was an excellent one, so far as it went, but Theodore
      Racksole, for his part, did not consider that it went quite far enough.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole opined, with peculiar glee, that he now had a tangible
      and definite clue for the catching of the Grand Babylon’s ex-waiter. He
      knew nothing of the Port of London, but he happened to know a good deal of
      the far more complicated, though somewhat smaller, Port of New York, and
      he was sure there ought to be no extraordinary difficulty in getting hold
      of Jules’ steam launch. To those who are not thoroughly familiar with it
      the River Thames and its docks, from London Bridge to Gravesend, seems a
      vast and uncharted wilderness of craft—a wilderness in which it
      would be perfectly easy to hide even a three-master successfully. To such
      people the idea of looking for a steam launch on the river would be about
      equivalent to the idea of looking for a needle in a bundle of hay. But the
      fact is, there are hundreds of men between St Katherine’s Wharf and
      Blackwall who literally know the Thames as the suburban householder knows
      his back-garden—who can recognize thousands of ships and put a name
      to them at a distance of half a mile, who are informed as to every
      movement of vessels on the great stream, who know all the captains, all
      the engineers, all the lightermen, all the pilots, all the licensed
      watermen, and all the unlicensed scoundrels from the Tower to Gravesend,
      and a lot further. By these experts of the Thames the slightest unusual
      event on the water is noticed and discussed—a wherry cannot change
      hands but they will guess shrewdly upon the price paid and the intentions
      of the new owner with regard to it. They have a habit of watching the
      river for the mere interest of the sight, and they talk about everything
      like housewives gathered of an evening round the cottage door. If the
      first mate of a Castle Liner gets the sack they will be able to tell you
      what he said to the captain, what the old man said to him, and what both
      said to the Board, and having finished off that affair they will
      cheerfully turn to discussing whether Bill Stevens sank his barge outside
      the West Indian No.2 by accident or on purpose.
    </p>
<p>
      Theodore Racksole had no satisfactory means of identifying the steam
      launch which carried away Mr Tom Jackson. The sky had clouded over soon
      after midnight, and there was also a slight mist, and he had only been
      able to make out that it was a low craft, about sixty feet long, probably
      painted black. He had personally kept a watch all through the night on
      vessels going upstream, and during the next morning he had a man to take
      his place who warned him whenever a steam launch went towards Westminster.
      At noon, after his conversation with Prince Aribert, he went down the
      river in a hired row-boat as far as the Custom House, and poked about
      everywhere, in search of any vessel which could by any possibility be the
      one he was in search of.
    </p>
<p>
      But he found nothing. He was, therefore, tolerably sure that the
      mysterious launch lay somewhere below the Custom House. At the Custom
      House stairs, he landed, and asked for a very high official—an
      official inferior only to a Commissioner—whom he had entertained
      once in New York, and who had met him in London on business at Lloyd’s. In
      the large but dingy office of this great man a long conversation took
      place—a conversation in which Racksole had to exercise a certain
      amount of persuasive power, and which ultimately ended in the high
      official ringing his bell.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Desire Mr Hazell—room No. 332—to speak to me,’ said the
      official to the boy who answered the summons, and then, turning to
      Racksole: ‘I need hardly repeat, my dear Mr Racksole, that this is
      strictly unofficial.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Agreed, of course,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr Hazell entered. He was a young man of about thirty, dressed in blue
      serge, with a pale, keen face, a brown moustache and a rather handsome
      brown beard.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Hazell,’ said the high official, ‘let me introduce you to Mr Theodore
      Racksole—you will doubtless be familiar with his name. Mr Hazell,’
      he went on to Racksole, ‘is one of our outdoor staff—what we call an
      examining officer. Just now he is doing night duty. He has a boat on the
      river and a couple of men, and the right to board and examine any craft
      whatever. What Mr Hazell and his crew don’t know about the Thames between
      here and Gravesend isn’t knowledge.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Glad to meet you, sir,’ said Racksole simply, and they shook hands.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole observed with satisfaction that Mr Hazell was entirely at his
      ease.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Now, Hazell,’ the high official continued, ‘Mr Racksole wants you to help
      in a little private expedition on the river to-night. I will give you a
      night’s leave. I sent for you partly because I thought you would enjoy the
      affair and partly because I think I can rely on you to regard it as
      entirely unofficial and not to talk about it. You understand? I dare say
      you will have no cause to regret having obliged Mr Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think I grasp the situation,’ said Hazell, with a slight smile.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And, by the way,’ added the high official, ‘although the business is
      unofficial, it might be well if you wore your official overcoat. See?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Decidedly,’ said Hazell; ‘I should have done so in any case.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now, Mr Hazell,’ said Racksole, ‘will you do me the pleasure of
      lunching with me? If you agree, I should like to lunch at the place you
      usually frequent.’
    </p>
<p>
      So it came to pass that Theodore Racksole and George Hazell, outdoor clerk
      in the Customs, lunched together at ‘Thomas’s Chop-House’, in the city of
      London, upon mutton-chops and coffee. The millionaire soon discovered that
      he had got hold of a keen-witted man and a person of much insight.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tell me,’ said Hazell, when they had reached the cigarette stage, ‘are
      the magazine writers anything like correct?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you mean?’ asked Racksole, mystified.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, you’re a millionaire—“one of the best”, I believe. One often
      sees articles on and interviews with millionaires, which describe their
      private railroad cars, their steam yachts on the Hudson, their marble
      stables, and so on, and so on. Do you happen to have those things?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have a private car on the New York Central, and I have a two thousand
      ton schooner-yacht—though it isn’t on the Hudson. It happens just
      now to be on East River. And I am bound to admit that the stables of my
      uptown place are fitted with marble.’ Racksole laughed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said Hazell. ‘Now I can believe that I am lunching with a
      millionaire.
    </p>
<p>
      It’s strange how facts like those—unimportant in themselves—appeal
      to the imagination. You seem to me a real millionaire now. You’ve given me
      some personal information; I’ll give you some in return. I earn three
      hundred a year, and perhaps sixty pounds a year extra for overtime. I live
      by myself in two rooms in Muscovy Court. I’ve as much money as I need, and
      I always do exactly what I like outside office. As regards the office, I
      do as little work as I can, on principle—it’s a fight between us and
      the Commissioners who shall get the best. They try to do us down, and we
      try to do them down—it’s pretty even on the whole. All’s fair in
      war, you know, and there ain’t no ten commandments in a Government
      office.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole laughed. ‘Can you get off this afternoon?’ he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Certainly,’ said Hazell; ‘I’ll get one of my pals to sign on for me, and
      then I shall be free.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said Racksole, ‘I should like you to come down with me to the
      Grand Babylon. Then we can talk over my little affair at length. And may
      we go on your boat? I want to meet your crew.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That will be all right,’ Hazell remarked. ‘My two men are the idlest,
      most soul-less chaps you ever saw. They eat too much, and they have an
      enormous appetite for beer; but they know the river, and they know their
      business, and they will do anything within the fair game if they are paid
      for it, and aren’t asked to hurry.’
    </p>
<p>
      That night, just after dark, Theodore Racksole embarked with his new
      friend George Hazell in one of the black-painted Customs wherries, manned
      by a crew of two men—both the later freemen of the river, a
      distinction which carries with it certain privileges unfamiliar to the
      mere landsman. It was a cloudy and oppressive evening, not a star showing
      to illumine the slow tide, now just past its flood. The vast forms of
      steamers at anchor—chiefly those of the General Steam Navigation and
      the Aberdeen Line—heaved themselves high out of the water, straining
      sluggishly at their mooring buoys. On either side the naked walls of
      warehouses rose like grey precipices from the stream, holding forth quaint
      arms of steam-cranes. To the west the Tower Bridge spanned the river with
      its formidable arch, and above that its suspended footpath—a hundred
      and fifty feet from earth.
    </p>
<p>
      Down towards the east and the Pool of London a forest of funnels and masts
      was dimly outlined against the sinister sky. Huge barges, each steered by
      a single man at the end of a pair of giant oars, lumbered and swirled
      down-stream at all angles. Occasionally a tug snorted busily past,
      flashing its red and green signals and dragging an unwieldy tail of barges
      in its wake. Then a Margate passenger steamer, its electric lights
      gleaming from every porthole, swerved round to anchor, with its load of
      two thousand fatigued excursionists. Over everything brooded an air of
      mystery—a spirit and feeling of strangeness, remoteness, and the
      inexplicable. As the broad flat little boat bobbed its way under the
      shadow of enormous hulks, beneath stretched hawsers, and past buoys
      covered with green slime, Racksole could scarcely believe that he was in
      the very heart of London—the most prosaic city in the world. He had
      a queer idea that almost anything might happen in this seeming waste of
      waters at this weird hour of ten o’clock. It appeared incredible to him
      that only a mile or two away people were sitting in theatres applauding
      farces, and that at Cannon Street Station, a few yards off, other people
      were calmly taking the train to various highly respectable suburbs whose
      names he was gradually learning. He had the uplifting sensation of being
      in another world which comes to us sometimes amid surroundings violently
      different from our usual surroundings. The most ordinary noises—of
      men calling, of a chain running through a slot, of a distant siren—translated
      themselves to his ears into terrible and haunting sounds, full of
      portentous significance. He looked over the side of the boat into the
      brown water, and asked himself what frightful secrets lay hidden in its
      depth. Then he put his hand into his hip-pocket and touched the stock of
      his Colt revolver—that familiar substance comforted him.
    </p>
<p>
      The oarsmen had instructions to drop slowly down to the Pool, as the wide
      reach below the Tower is called. These two men had not been previously
      informed of the precise object of the expedition, but now that they were
      safely afloat Hazell judged it expedient to give them some notion of it.
      ‘We expect to come across a rather suspicious steam launch,’ he said. ‘My
      friend here is very anxious to get a sight of her, and until he has seen
      her nothing definite can be done.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What sort of a craft is she, sir?’ asked the stroke oar, a fat-faced man
      who seemed absolutely incapable of any serious exertion.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I don’t know,’ Racksole replied; ‘but as near as I can judge, she’s about
      sixty feet in length, and painted black. I fancy I shall recognize her
      when I see her.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not much to go by, that,’ exclaimed the other man curtly. But he said no
      more. He, as well as his mate, had received from Theodore Racksole one
      English sovereign as a kind of preliminary fee, and an English sovereign
      will do a lot towards silencing the natural sarcastic tendencies and free
      speech of a Thames waterman.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There’s one thing I noticed,’ said Racksole suddenly, ‘and I forgot to
      tell you of it, Mr Hazell. Her screw seemed to move with a rather
      irregular, lame sort of beat.’
    </p>
<p>
      Both watermen burst into a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh,’ said the fat rower, ‘I know what you’re after, sir—it’s Jack
      Everett’s launch, commonly called “Squirm”. She’s got a four-bladed
      propeller, and one blade is broken off short.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ay, that’s it, sure enough,’ agreed the man in the bows. ‘And if it’s her
      you want, I seed her lying up against Cherry Gardens Pier this very
      morning.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Let us go to Cherry Gardens Pier by all means, as soon as possible,’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole said, and the boat swung across stream and then began to creep
      down by the right bank, feeling its way past wharves, many of which, even
      at that hour, were still busy with their cranes, that descended empty into
      the bellies of ships and came up full. As the two watermen gingerly
      manoeuvred the boat on the ebbing tide, Hazell explained to the
      millionaire that the ‘Squirm’ was one of the most notorious craft on the
      river. It appeared that when anyone had a nefarious or underhand scheme
      afoot which necessitated river work Everett’s launch was always available
      for a suitable monetary consideration. The ‘Squirm’ had got itself into a
      thousand scrapes, and out of those scrapes again with safety, if not
      precisely with honour. The river police kept a watchful eye on it, and the
      chief marvel about the whole thing was that old Everett, the owner, had
      never yet been seriously compromised in any illegal escapade. Not once had
      the officer of the law been able to prove anything definite against the
      proprietor of the ‘Squirm’, though several of its quondam hirers were at
      that very moment in various of Her Majesty’s prisons throughout the
      country. Latterly, however, the launch, with its damaged propeller, which
      Everett consistently refused to have repaired, had acquired an evil
      reputation, even among evil-doers, and this fraternity had gradually come
      to abandon it for less easily recognizable craft.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Your friend, Mr Tom Jackson,’ said Hazell to Racksole, ‘committed an
      error of discretion when he hired the “Squirm”. A scoundrel of his
      experience and calibre ought certainly to have known better than that. You
      cannot fail to get a clue now.’
    </p>
<p>
      By this time the boat was approaching Cherry Gardens Pier, but
      unfortunately a thin night-fog had swept over the river, and objects could
      not be discerned with any clearness beyond a distance of thirty yards. As
      the Customs boat scraped down past the pier all its occupants strained
      eyes for a glimpse of the mysterious launch, but nothing could be seen of
      it. The boat continued to float idly down-stream, the men resting on their
      oars.
    </p>
<p>
      Then they narrowly escaped bumping a large Norwegian sailing vessel at
      anchor with her stem pointing down-stream. This ship they passed on the
      port side. Just as they got clear of her bowsprit the fat man cried out
      excitedly, ‘There’s her nose!’ and he put the boat about and began to pull
      back against the tide. And surely the missing ‘Squirm’ was comfortably
      anchored on the starboard quarter of the Norwegian ship, hidden neatly
      between the ship and the shore. The men pulled very quietly alongside.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Six THE NIGHT CHASE AND THE MUDLARK
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘I’LL board her to start with,’ said Hazell, whispering to Racksole. ‘I’ll
      make out that I suspect they’ve got dutiable goods on board, and that will
      give me a chance to have a good look at her.’
    </p>
<p>
      Dressed in his official overcoat and peaked cap, he stepped, rather
      jauntily as Racksole thought, on to the low deck of the launch. ‘Anyone
      aboard?’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole heard him cry out, and a woman’s voice answered. ‘I’m a Customs
      examining officer, and I want to search the launch,’ Hazell shouted, and
      then disappeared down into the little saloon amidships, and Racksole heard
      no more. It seemed to the millionaire that Hazell had been gone hours, but
      at length he returned.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Can’t find anything,’ he said, as he jumped into the boat, and then
      privately to Racksole: ‘There’s a woman on board. Looks as if she might
      coincide with your description of Miss Spencer. Steam’s up, but there’s no
      engineer. I asked where the engineer was, and she inquired what business
      that was of mine, and requested me to get through with my own business and
      clear off. Seems rather a smart sort. I poked my nose into everything, but
      I saw no sign of any one else. Perhaps we’d better pull away and lie near
      for a bit, just to see if anything queer occurs.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’re quite sure he isn’t on board?’ Racksole asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Quite,’ said Hazell positively: ‘I know how to search a vessel. See
      this,’ and he handed to Racksole a sort of steel skewer, about two feet
      long, with a wooden handle. ‘That,’ he said, ‘is one of the Customs’ aids
      to searching.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose it wouldn’t do to go on board and carry off the lady?’ Racksole
      suggested doubtfully.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ Hazell began, with equal doubtfulness, ‘as for that—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where’s ‘e orf?’ It was the man in the bows who interrupted Hazell.
    </p>
<p>
      Following the direction of the man’s finger, both Hazell and Racksole saw
      with more or less distinctness a dinghy slip away from the forefoot of the
      Norwegian vessel and disappear downstream into the mist.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s Jules, I’ll swear,’ cried Racksole. ‘After him, men. Ten pounds
      apiece if we overtake him!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lay down to it now, boys!’ said Hazell, and the heavy Customs boat shot
      out in pursuit.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘This is going to be a lark,’ Racksole remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Depends on what you call a lark,’ said Hazell; ‘it’s not much of a lark
      tearing down midstream like this in a fog. You never know when you mayn’t
      be in kingdom come with all these barges knocking around. I expect that
      chap hid in the dinghy when he first caught sight of us, and then slipped
      his painter as soon as I’d gone.’
    </p>
<p>
      The boat was moving at a rapid pace with the tide. Steering was a matter
      of luck and instinct more than anything else. Every now and then Hazell,
      who held the lines, was obliged to jerk the boat’s head sharply round to
      avoid a barge or an anchored vessel. It seemed to Racksole that vessels
      were anchored all over the stream. He looked about him anxiously, but for
      a long time he could see nothing but mist and vague nautical forms. Then
      suddenly he said, quietly enough, ‘We’re on the right road; I can see him
      ahead.
    </p>
<p>
      We’re gaining on him.’ In another minute the dinghy was plainly visible,
      not twenty yards away, and the sculler—sculling frantically now—was
      unmistakably Jules—Jules in a light tweed suit and a bowler hat.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You were right,’ Hazell said; ‘this is a lark. I believe I’m getting
      quite excited. It’s more exciting than playing the trombone in an
      orchestra. I’ll run him down, eh?—and then we can drag the chap in
      from the water.’
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole nodded, but at that moment a barge, with her red sails set, stood
      out of the fog clean across the bows of the Customs boat, which narrowly
      escaped instant destruction. When they got clear, and the usual
      interchange of calm, nonchalant swearing was over, the dinghy was barely
      to be discerned in the mist, and the fat man was breathing in such a
      manner that his sighs might almost have been heard on the banks. Racksole
      wanted violently to do something, but there was nothing to do; he could
      only sit supine by Hazell’s side in the stern-sheets. Gradually they began
      again to overtake the dinghy, whose one-man crew was evidently tiring. As
      they came up, hand over fist, the dinghy’s nose swerved aside, and the
      tiny craft passed down a water-lane between two anchored mineral barges,
      which lay black and deserted about fifty yards from the Surrey shore. ‘To
      starboard,’ said Racksole. ‘No, man!’
    </p>
<p>
      Hazell replied; ‘we can’t get through there. He’s bound to come out below;
      it’s only a feint. I’ll keep our nose straight ahead.’
    </p>
<p>
      And they went on, the fat man pounding away, with a face which glistened
      even in the thick gloom. It was an empty dinghy which emerged from between
      the two barges and went drifting and revolving down towards Greenwich.
    </p>
<p>
      The fat man gasped a word to his comrade, and the Customs boat stopped
      dead.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘’E’s all right,’ said the man in the bows. ‘If it’s ‘im you want, ‘e’s on
      one o’ them barges, so you’ve only got to step on and take ‘im orf.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s all,’ said a voice out of the depths of the nearest barge, and it
      was the voice of Jules, otherwise known as Mr Tom Jackson.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘’Ear ‘im?’ said the fat man smiling. ‘’E’s a good ‘un, ‘e is. But if I
      was you, Mr Hazell, or you, sir, I shouldn’t step on to that barge so
      quick as all that.’
    </p>
<p>
      They backed the boat under the stem of the nearest barge and gazed
      upwards.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s all right,’ said Racksole to Hazell; ‘I’ve got a revolver. How can I
      clamber up there?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes, I dare say you’ve got a revolver all right,’ Hazell replied sharply.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you mustn’t use it. There mustn’t be any noise. We should have the
      river police down on us in a twinkling if there was a revolver shot, and
      it would be the ruin of me. If an inquiry was held the Commissioners
      wouldn’t take any official notice of the fact that my superior officer had
      put me on to this job, and I should be requested to leave the service.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Have no fear on that score,’ said Racksole. ‘I shall, of course, take all
      responsibility.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It wouldn’t matter how much responsibility you took,’ Hazell retorted;
      ‘you wouldn’t put me back into the service, and my career would be at an
      end.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But there are other careers,’ said Racksole, who was really anxious to
      lame his ex-waiter by means of a judiciously-aimed bullet. ‘There are
      other careers.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The Customs is my career,’ said Hazell, ‘so let’s have no shooting. We’ll
      wait about a bit; he can’t escape. You can have my skewer if you like’—and
      he gave Racksole his searching instrument. ‘And you can do what you
      please, provided you do it neatly and don’t make a row over it.’
    </p>
<p>
      For a few moments the four men were passive in the boat, surrounded by
      swirling mist, with black water beneath them, and towering above them a
      half-loaded barge with a desperate and resourceful man on board. Suddenly
      the mist parted and shrivelled away in patches, as though before the
      breath of some monster. The sky was visible; it was a clear sky, and the
      moon was shining. The transformation was just one of those meteorological
      quick-changes which happen most frequently on a great river.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s a sight better,’ said the fat man. At the same moment a head
      appeared over the edge of the barge. It was Jules’ face—dark,
      sinister and leering.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is it Mr Racksole in that boat?’ he inquired calmly; ‘because if so, let
      Mr Racksole step up. Mr Racksole has caught me, and he can have me for the
      asking. Here I am.’ He stood up to his full height on the barge, tall
      against the night sky, and all the occupants of the boat could see that he
      held firmly clasped in his right hand a short dagger. ‘Now, Mr Racksole,
      you’ve been after me for a long time,’ he continued; ‘here I am. Why don’t
      you step up? If you haven’t got the pluck yourself, persuade someone else
      to step up in your place ... the same fair treatment will be accorded to
      all.’ And Jules laughed a low, penetrating laugh.
    </p>
<p>
      He was in the midst of this laugh when he lurched suddenly forward.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What’r’ you doing of aboard my barge? Off you goes!’ It was a boy’s small
      shrill voice that sounded in the night. A ragged boy’s small form had
      appeared silently behind Jules, and two small arms with a vicious shove
      precipitated him into the water. He fell with a fine gurgling splash. It
      was at once obvious that swimming was not among Jules’ accomplishments. He
      floundered wildly and sank. When he reappeared he was dragged into the
      Customs boat. Rope was produced, and in a minute or two the man lay
      ignominiously bound in the bottom of the boat. With the aid of a mudlark—a
      mere barge boy, who probably had no more right on the barge than Jules
      himself—Racksole had won his game. For the first time for several
      weeks the millionaire experienced a sensation of equanimity and
      satisfaction. He leaned over the prostrate form of Jules, Hazell’s
      professional skewer in his hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What are you going to do with him now?’ asked Hazell.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘We’ll row up to the landing steps in front of the Grand Babylon. He shall
      be well lodged at my hotel, I promise him.’
    </p>
<p>
      Jules spoke no word.
    </p>
<p>
      Before Racksole parted company with the Customs man that night Jules had
      been safely transported into the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel and the two watermen
      had received their £10 apiece.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will sleep here?’ said the millionaire to Mr George Hazell. ‘It is
      late.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With pleasure,’ said Hazell. The next morning he found a sumptuous
      breakfast awaiting him, and in his table-napkin was a Bank of England note
      for a hundred pounds. But, though he did not hear of them till much later,
      many things had happened before Hazell consumed that sumptuous breakfast.
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Seven THE CONFESSION OF MR TOM JACKSON
    </h2>
<p>
      IT happened that the small bedroom occupied by Jules during the years he
      was head-waiter at the Grand Babylon had remained empty since his sudden
      dismissal by Theodore Racksole. No other head-waiter had been formally
      appointed in his place; and, indeed, the absence of one man—even the
      unique Jules—could scarcely have been noticed in the enormous staff
      of a place like the Grand Babylon. The functions of a head-waiter are
      generally more ornamental, spectacular, and morally impressive than
      useful, and it was so at the great hotel on the Embankment. Racksole
      accordingly had the excellent idea of transporting his prisoner, with as
      much secrecy as possible, to this empty bedroom. There proved to be no
      difficulty in doing so; Jules showed himself perfectly amenable to a show
      of superior force.
    </p>
<p>
      Racksole took upstairs with him an old commissionaire who had been
      attached to the outdoor service of the hotel for many years—a
      grey-haired man, wiry as a terrier and strong as a mastiff. Entering the
      bedroom with Jules, whose hands were bound, he told the commissionaire to
      remain outside the door.
    </p>
<p>
      Jules’ bedroom was quite an ordinary apartment, though perhaps slightly
      superior to the usual accommodation provided for servants in the
      caravanserais of the West End. It was about fourteen by twelve. It was
      furnished with a bedstead, a small wardrobe, a small washstand and
      dressing-table, and two chairs. There were two hooks behind the door, a
      strip of carpet by the bed, and some cheap ornaments on the iron
      mantelpiece. There was also one electric light. The window was a little
      square one, high up from the floor, and it looked on the inner quadrangle.
    </p>
<p>
      The room was on the top storey—the eighth—and from it you had
      a view sheer to the ground. Twenty feet below ran a narrow cornice about a
      foot wide; three feet or so above the window another and wider cornice
      jutted out, and above that was the high steep roof of the hotel, though
      you could not see it from the window. As Racksole examined the window and
      the outlook, he said to himself that Jules could not escape by that exit,
      at any rate. He gave a glance up the chimney, and saw that the flue was
      far too small to admit a man’s body.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he called in the commissionaire, and together they bound Jules firmly
      to the bedstead, allowing him, however, to lie down. All the while the
      captive never opened his mouth—merely smiled a smile of disdain.
      Finally Racksole removed the ornaments, the carpet, the chairs and the
      hooks, and wrenched away the switch of the electric light. Then he and the
      commissionaire left the room, and Racksole locked the door on the outside
      and put the key in his pocket.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You will keep watch here,’ he said to the commissionaire, ‘through the
      night. You can sit on this chair. Don’t go to sleep. If you hear the
      slightest noise in the room blow your cab-whistle; I will arrange to
      answer the signal. If there is no noise do nothing whatever. I don’t want
      this talked about, you understand. I shall trust you; you can trust me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But the servants will see me here when they get up to-morrow,’ said the
      commissionaire, with a faint smile, ‘and they will be pretty certain to
      ask what I’m doing of up here. What shall I say to ‘em?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’ve been a soldier, haven’t you?’ asked Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ve seen three campaigns, sir,’ was the reply, and, with a gesture of
      pardonable pride, the grey-haired fellow pointed to the medals on his
      breast.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, supposing you were on sentry duty and some meddlesome person in
      camp asked you what you were doing—what should you say?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I should tell him to clear off or take the consequences, and pretty quick
      too.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do that to-morrow morning, then, if necessary,’ said Racksole, and
      departed.
    </p>
<p>
      It was then about one o’clock a.m. The millionaire retired to bed—not
      his own bed, but a bed on the seventh storey. He did not, however, sleep
      very long. Shortly after dawn he was wide awake, and thinking busily about
      Jules.
    </p>
<p>
      He was, indeed, very curious to know Jules’ story, and he determined, if
      the thing could be done at all, by persuasion or otherwise, to extract it
      from him. With a man of Theodore Racksole’s temperament there is no time
      like the present, and at six o’clock, as the bright morning sun brought
      gaiety into the window, he dressed and went upstairs again to the eighth
      storey. The commissionaire sat stolid, but alert on his chair, and, at the
      sight of his master, rose and saluted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Anything happened?’ Racksole asked.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nothing, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Servants say anything?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only a dozen or so of ‘em are up yet, sir. One of ‘em asked what I was
      playing at, and so I told her I was looking after a bull bitch and a
      litter of pups that you was very particular about, sir.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good,’ said Racksole, as he unlocked the door and entered the room. All
      was exactly as he had left it, except that Jules who had been lying on his
      back, had somehow turned over and was now lying on his face. He gazed
      silently, scowling at the millionaire. Racksole greeted him and
      ostentatiously took a revolver from his hip-pocket and laid it on the
      dressing-table. Then he seated himself on the dressing-table by the side
      of the revolver, his legs dangling an inch or two above the floor.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want to have a talk to you, Jackson,’ he began.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You can talk to me as much as you like,’ said Jules. ‘I shan’t interfere,
      you may bet on that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I should like you to answer some questions.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s different,’ said Jules. ‘I’m not going to answer any questions
      while I’m tied up like this. You may bet on that, too.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It will pay you to be reasonable,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’m not going to answer any questions while I’m tied up.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I’ll unfasten your legs, if you like,’ Racksole suggested politely, ‘then
      you can sit up. It’s no use you pretending you’ve been uncomfortable,
      because I know you haven’t. I calculate you’ve been treated very
      handsomely, my son. There you are!’ and he loosened the lower extremities
      of his prisoner from their bonds. ‘Now I repeat you may as well be
      reasonable. You may as well admit that you’ve been fairly beaten in the
      game and act accordingly. I was determined to beat you, by myself, without
      the police, and I’ve done it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’ve done yourself,’ retorted Jules. ‘You’ve gone against the law. If
      you’d had any sense you wouldn’t have meddled; you’d have left everything
      to the police. They’d have muddled about for a year or two, and then done
      nothing. Who’s going to tell the police now? Are you? Are you going to
      give me up to ‘em, and say, “Here, I’ve caught him for you”. If you do
      they’ll ask you to explain several things, and then you’ll look foolish.
      One crime doesn’t excuse another, and you’ll find that out.’
    </p>
<p>
      With unerring insight, Jules had perceived exactly the difficulty of
      Racksole’s position, and it was certainly a difficulty which Racksole did
      not attempt to minimize to himself. He knew well that it would have to be
      faced. He did not, however, allow Jules to guess his thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Meanwhile,’ he said calmly to the other, ‘you’re here and my prisoner.
    </p>
<p>
      You’ve committed a variegated assortment of crimes, and among them is
      murder. You are due to be hung. You know that. There is no reason why I
      should call in the police at all. It will be perfectly easy for me to
      finish you off, as you deserve, myself. I shall only be carrying out
      justice, and robbing the hangman of his fee. Precisely as I brought you
      into the hotel, I can take you out again. A few days ago you borrowed or
      stole a steam yacht at Ostend. What you have done with it I don’t know,
      nor do I care. But I strongly suspect that my daughter had a narrow escape
      of being murdered on your steam yacht. Now I have a steam yacht of my own.
      Suppose I use it as you used yours! Suppose I smuggle you on to it, steam
      out to sea, and then ask you to step off it into the ocean one night. Such
      things have been done.
    </p>
<p>
      Such things will be done again. If I acted so, I should at least, have the
      satisfaction of knowing that I had relieved society from the incubus of a
      scoundrel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you won’t,’ Jules murmured.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ said Racksole steadily, ‘I won’t—if you behave yourself this
      morning. But I swear to you that if you don’t I will never rest till you
      are dead, police or no police. You don’t know Theodore Racksole.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I believe you mean it,’ Jules exclaimed, with an air of surprised
      interest, as though he had discovered something of importance.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I believe I do,’ Racksole resumed. ‘Now listen. At the best, you will be
      given up to the police. At the worst, I shall deal with you myself. With
      the police you may have a chance—you may get off with twenty years’
      penal servitude, because, though it is absolutely certain that you
      murdered Reginald Dimmock, it would be a little difficult to prove the
      case against you. But with me you would have no chance whatever. I have a
      few questions to put to you, and it will depend on how you answer them
      whether I give you up to the police or take the law into my own hands. And
      let me tell you that the latter course would be much simpler for me. And I
      would take it, too, did I not feel that you were a very clever and
      exceptional man; did I not have a sort of sneaking admiration for your
      detestable skill and ingenuity.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You think, then, that I am clever?’ said Jules. ‘You are right. I am. I
      should have been much too clever for you if luck had not been against me.
    </p>
<p>
      You owe your victory, not to skill, but to luck.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is what the vanquished always say. Waterloo was a bit of pure luck
      for the English, no doubt, but it was Waterloo all the same.’
    </p>
<p>
      Jules yawned elaborately. ‘What do you want to know?’ he inquired, with
      politeness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘First and foremost, I want to know the names of your accomplices inside
      this hotel.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have no more,’ said Jules. ‘Rocco was the last.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Don’t begin by lying to me. If you had no accomplice, how did you
      contrive that one particular bottle of Romanée-Conti should be served to
      his Highness Prince Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you discovered that in time, did you?’ said Jules. ‘I was afraid so.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me explain that that needed no accomplice. The bottle was topmost in
      the bin, and naturally it would be taken. Moreover, I left it sticking out
      a little further than the rest.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You did not arrange, then, that Hubbard should be taken ill the night
      before last?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had no idea,’ said Jules, ‘that the excellent Hubbard was not enjoying
      his accustomed health.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Tell me,’ said Racksole, ‘who or what is the origin of your vendetta
      against the life of Prince Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had no vendetta against the life of Prince Eugen,’ said Jules, ‘at
      least, not to begin with. I merely undertook, for a consideration, to see
      that Prince Eugen did not have an interview with a certain Mr Sampson Levi
      in London before a certain date, that was all. It seemed simple enough. I
      had been engaged in far more complicated transactions before. I was
      convinced that I could manage it, with the help of Rocco and Em—and
      Miss Spencer.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is that woman your wife?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘She would like to be,’ he sneered. ‘Please don’t interrupt. I had
      completed my arrangements, when you so inconsiderately bought the hotel. I
      don’t mind admitting now that from the very moment when you came across me
      that night in the corridor I was secretly afraid of you, though I scarcely
      admitted the fact even to myself then. I thought it safer to shift the
      scene of our operations to Ostend. I had meant to deal with Prince Eugen
      in this hotel, but I decided, then, to intercept him on the Continent, and
      I despatched Miss Spencer with some instructions. Troubles never come
      singly, and it happened that just then that fool Dimmock, who had been in
      the swim with us, chose to prove refractory. The slightest hitch would
      have upset everything, and I was obliged to—to clear him off the
      scene. He wanted to back out—he had a bad attack of conscience, and
      violent measures were essential. I regret his untimely decease, but he
      brought it on himself. Well, everything was going serenely when you and
      your brilliant daughter, apparently determined to meddle, turned up again
      among us at Ostend. Only twenty-four hours, however, had to elapse before
      the date which had been mentioned to me by my employers. I kept poor
      little Eugen for the allotted time, and then you managed to get hold of
      him. I do not deny that you scored there, though, according to my original
      instructions, you scored too late. The time had passed, and so, so far as
      I knew, it didn’t matter a pin whether Prince Eugen saw Mr Sampson Levi or
      not. But my employers were still uneasy. They were uneasy even after
      little Eugen had lain ill in Ostend for several weeks. It appears that
      they feared that even at that date an interview between Prince Eugen and
      Mr Sampson Levi might work harm to them. So they applied to me again. This
      time they wanted Prince Eugen to be—em—finished off entirely.
      They offered high terms.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What terms?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I had received fifty thousand pounds for the first job, of which Rocco
      had half. Rocco was also to be made a member of a certain famous European
      order, if things went right. That was what he coveted far more than the
      money—the vain fellow! For the second job I was offered a hundred
      thousand. A tolerably large sum. I regret that I have not been able to
      earn it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Do you mean to tell me,’ asked Racksole, horror-struck by this calm
      confession, in spite of his previous knowledge, ‘that you were offered a
      hundred thousand pounds to poison Prince Eugen?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You put it rather crudely,’ said Jules in reply. ‘I prefer to say that I
      was offered a hundred thousand pounds if Prince Eugen should die within a
      reasonable time.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And who were your damnable employers?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That, honestly, I do not know.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You know, I suppose, who paid you the first fifty thousand pounds, and
      who promised you the hundred thousand.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well,’ said Jules, ‘I know vaguely. I know that he came via Vienna from—em—Bosnia.
      My impression was that the affair had some bearing, direct or indirect, on
      the projected marriage of the King of Bosnia. He is a young monarch,
      scarcely out of political leading-strings, as it were, and doubtless his
      Ministers thought that they had better arrange his marriage for him. They
      tried last year, and failed because the Princess whom they had in mind had
      cast her sparkling eyes on another Prince. That Prince happened to be
      Prince Eugen of Posen. The Ministers of the King of Bosnia knew exactly
      the circumstances of Prince Eugen. They knew that he could not marry
      without liquidating his debts, and they knew that he could only liquidate
      his debts through this Jew, Sampson Levi. Unfortunately for me, they
      ultimately wanted to make too sure of Prince Eugen. They were afraid he
      might after all arrange his marriage without the aid of Mr Sampson Levi,
      and so—well, you know the rest.... It is a pity that the poor little
      innocent King of Bosnia can’t have the Princess of his Ministers’ choice.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Then you think that the King himself had no part in this abominable
      crime?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I think decidedly not.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am glad of that,’ said Racksole simply. ‘And now, the name of your
      immediate employer.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He was merely an agent. He called himself Sleszak—S-l-e-s-z-a-k.
      But I imagine that that wasn’t his real name. I don’t know his real name.
      An old man, he often used to be found at the HÃ´tel Ritz, Paris.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Sleszak and I will meet,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Not in this world,’ said Jules quickly. ‘He is dead. I heard only last
      night—just before our little tussle.’
    </p>
<p>
      There was a silence.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It is well,’ said Racksole at length. ‘Prince Eugen lives, despite all
      plots. After all, justice is done.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Mr Racksole is here, but he can see no one, Miss.’ The words came from
      behind the door, and the voice was the commissionaire’s. Racksole started
      up, and went towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nonsense,’ was the curt reply, in feminine tones. ‘Move aside instantly.’
    </p>
<p>
      The door opened, and Nella entered. There were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh! Dad,’ she exclaimed, ‘I’ve only just heard you were in the hotel. We
      looked for you everywhere. Come at once, Prince Eugen is dying—’
      Then she saw the man sitting on the bed, and stopped.
    </p>
<p>
      Later, when Jules was alone again, he remarked to himself, ‘I may get that
      hundred thousand.’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Eight THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE
    </h2>
<p>
      WHEN, immediately after the episode of the bottle of Romanée-Conti in the
      State dining-room, Prince Aribert and old Hans found that Prince Eugen had
      sunk in an unconscious heap over his chair, both the former thought, at
      the first instant, that Eugen must have already tasted the poisoned wine.
      But a moment’s reflection showed that this was not possible. If the
      Hereditary Prince of Posen was dying or dead, his condition was due to
      some other agency than the Romanée-Conti. Aribert bent over him, and a
      powerful odour from the man’s lips at once disclosed the cause of the
      disaster: it was the odour of laudanum. Indeed, the smell of that sinister
      drug seemed now to float heavily over the whole table. Across Aribert’s
      mind there flashed then the true explanation. Prince Eugen, taking
      advantage of Aribert’s attention being momentarily diverted; and yielding
      to a sudden impulse of despair, had decided to poison himself, and had
      carried out his intention on the spot.
    </p>
<p>
      The laudanum must have been already in his pocket, and this fact went to
      prove that the unfortunate Prince had previously contemplated such a
      proceeding, even after his definite promise. Aribert remembered now with
      painful vividness his nephew’s words: ‘I withdraw my promise. Observe that—I
      withdraw it.’ It must have been instantly after the utterance of that
      formal withdrawal that Eugen attempted to destroy himself.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s laudanum, Hans,’ Aribert exclaimed, rather helplessly.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Surely his Highness has not taken poison?’ said Hans. ‘It is impossible!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I fear it is only too possible,’ said the other. ‘It’s laudanum. What are
      we to do? Quick, man!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘His Highness must be roused, Prince. He must have an emetic. We had
      better carry him to the bedroom.’
    </p>
<p>
      They did, and laid him on the great bed; and then Aribert mixed an emetic
      of mustard and water, and administered it, but without any effect. The
      sufferer lay motionless, with every muscle relaxed. His skin was ice-cold
      to the touch, and the eyelids, half-drawn, showed that the pupils were
      painfully contracted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Go out, and send for a doctor, Hans. Say that Prince Eugen has been
      suddenly taken ill, but that it isn’t serious. The truth must never be
      known.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He must be roused, sire,’ Hans said again, as he hurried from the room.
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert lifted his nephew from the bed, shook him, pinched him, flicked
      him cruelly, shouted at him, dragged him about, but to no avail. At length
      he desisted, from mere physical fatigue, and laid the Prince back again on
      the bed. Every minute that elapsed seemed an hour. Alone with the
      unconscious organism in the silence of the great stately chamber, under
      the cold yellow glare of the electric lights, Aribert became a prey to the
      most despairing thoughts. The tragedy of his nephew’s career forced itself
      upon him, and it occurred to him that an early and shameful death had all
      along been inevitable for this good-natured, weak-purposed, unhappy child
      of a historic throne. A little good fortune, and his character, so evenly
      balanced between right and wrong, might have followed the proper path, and
      Eugen might have figured at any rate with dignity on the European stage.
      But now it appeared that all was over, the last stroke played. And in this
      disaster Aribert saw the ruin of his own hopes. For Aribert would have to
      occupy his nephew’s throne, and he felt instinctively that nature had not
      cut him out for a throne. By a natural impulse he inwardly rebelled
      against the prospect of monarchy. Monarchy meant so much for which he knew
      himself to be entirely unfitted. It meant a political marriage, which
      means a forced marriage, a union against inclination. And then what of
      Nella—Nella!
    </p>
<p>
      Hans returned. ‘I have sent for the nearest doctor, and also for a
      specialist,’ he said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Good,’ said Aribert. ‘I hope they will hurry.’ Then he sat down and wrote
      a card. ‘Take this yourself to Miss Racksole. If she is out of the hotel,
      ascertain where she is and follow her. Understand, it is of the first
      importance.’
    </p>
<p>
      Hans bowed, and departed for the second time, and Aribert was alone again.
    </p>
<p>
      He gazed at Eugen, and made another frantic attempt to rouse him from the
      deadly stupor, but it was useless. He walked away to the window: through
      the opened casement he could hear the tinkle of passing hansoms on the
      Embankment below, whistles of door-keepers, and the hoot of steam tugs on
      the river. The world went on as usual, it appeared. It was an absurd
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      He desired nothing better than to abandon his princely title, and live as
      a plain man, the husband of the finest woman on earth.... But now!...
    </p>
<p>
      Pah! How selfish he was, to be thinking of himself when Eugen lay dying.
      Yet—Nella!
    </p>
<p>
      The door opened, and a man entered, who was obviously the doctor. A few
      curt questions, and he had grasped the essentials of the case. ‘Oblige me
      by ringing the bell, Prince. I shall want some hot water, and an
      able-bodied man and a nurse.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who wants a nurse?’ said a voice, and Nella came quietly in. ‘I am a
      nurse,’ she added to the doctor, ‘and at your orders.’
    </p>
<p>
      The next two hours were a struggle between life and death. The first
      doctor, a specialist who followed him, Nella, Prince Aribert, and old Hans
      formed, as it were, a league to save the dying man. None else in the hotel
      knew the real seriousness of the case. When a Prince falls ill, and
      especially by his own act, the precise truth is not issued broadcast to
      the universe.
    </p>
<p>
      According to official intelligence, a Prince is never seriously ill until
      he is dead. Such is statecraft.
    </p>
<p>
      The worst feature of Prince Eugen’s case was that emetics proved futile.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither of the doctors could explain their failure, but it was only too
      apparent. The league was reduced to helplessness. At last the great
      specialist from Manchester Square gave it out that there was no chance for
      Prince Eugen unless the natural vigour of his constitution should prove
      capable of throwing off the poison unaided by scientific assistance, as a
      drunkard can sleep off his potion. Everything had been tried, even to
      artificial respiration and the injection of hot coffee. Having emitted
      this pronouncement, the great specialist from Manchester Square left. It
      was one o’clock in the morning. By one of those strange and futile
      coincidences which sometimes startle us by their subtle significance, the
      specialist met Theodore Racksole and his captive as they were entering the
      hotel. Neither had the least suspicion of the other’s business.
    </p>
<p>
      In the State bedroom the small group of watchers surrounded the bed. The
      slow minutes filed away in dreary procession. Another hour passed. Then
      the figure on the bed, hitherto so motionless, twitched and moved; the
      lips parted.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is hope,’ said the doctor, and administered a stimulant which was
      handed to him by Nella.
    </p>
<p>
      In a quarter of an hour the patient had regained consciousness. For the
      ten thousandth time in the history of medicine a sound constitution had
      accomplished a miracle impossible to the accumulated medical skill of
      centuries.
    </p>
<p>
      In due course the doctor left, saying that Prince Eugen was ‘on the high
      road to recovery,’ and promising to come again within a few hours. Morning
      had dawned. Nella drew the great curtains, and let in a flood of sunlight.
    </p>
<p>
      Old Hans, overcome by fatigue, dozed in a chair in a far corner of the
      room.
    </p>
<p>
      The reaction had been too much for him. Nella and Prince Aribert looked at
      each other. They had not exchanged a word about themselves, yet each knew
      what the other had been thinking. They clasped hands with a perfect
      understanding. Their brief love-making had been of the silent kind, and it
      was silent now. No word was uttered. A shadow had passed from over them,
      but only their eyes expressed relief and joy.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aribert!’ The faint call came from the bed. Aribert went to the bedside,
      while Nella remained near the window.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What is it, Eugen?’ he said. ‘You are better now.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You think so?’ murmured the other. ‘I want you to forgive me for all
      this, Aribert. I must have caused you an intolerable trouble. I did it so
      clumsily; that is what annoys me. Laudanum was a feeble expedient; but I
      could think of nothing else, and I daren’t ask anyone for advice. I was
      obliged to go out and buy the stuff for myself. It was all very awkward.
    </p>
<p>
      But, thank goodness, it has not been ineffectual.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What do you mean, Eugen? You are better. In a day or so you will be
      perfectly recovered.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I am dying,’ said Eugen quietly. ‘Do not be deceived. I die because I
      wish to die. It is bound to be so. I know by the feel of my heart. In a
      few hours it will be over. The throne of Posen will be yours, Aribert. You
      will fill it more worthily than I have done. Don’t let them know over
      there that I poisoned myself. Swear Hans to secrecy; swear the doctors to
      secrecy; and breathe no word yourself. I have been a fool, but I do not
      wish it to be known that I was also a coward. Perhaps it is not cowardice;
      perhaps it is courage, after all—courage to cut the knot. I could
      not have survived the disgrace of any revelations, Aribert, and
      revelations would have been sure to come. I have made a fool of myself,
      but I am ready to pay for it. We of Posen—we always pay—everything
      except our debts. Ah! those debts! Had it not been for those I could have
      faced her who was to have been my wife, to have shared my throne. I could
      have hidden my past, and begun again. With her help I really could have
      begun again. But Fate has been against me—always! always! By the
      way, what was that plot against me, Aribert? I forget, I forget.’
    </p>
<p>
      His eyes closed. There was a sudden noise. Old Hans had slipped from his
      chair to the floor. He picked himself up, dazed, and crept shamefacedly
      out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert took his nephew’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nonsense, Eugen! You are dreaming. You will be all right soon. Pull
      yourself together.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘All because of a million,’ the sick man moaned. ‘One miserable million
      English pounds. The national debt of Posen is fifty millions, and I, the
      Prince of Posen, couldn’t borrow one. If I could have got it, I might have
      held my head up again. Good-bye, Aribert.... Who is that girl?’
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert looked up. Nella was standing silent at the foot of the bed, her
      eyes moist. She came round to the bedside, and put her hand on the
      patient’s heart. Scarcely could she feel its pulsation, and to Aribert her
      eyes expressed a sudden despair.
    </p>
<p>
      At that moment Hans re-entered the room and beckoned to her.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have heard that Herr Racksole has returned to the hotel,’ he whispered,
      ‘and that he has captured that man Jules, who they say is such a villain.’
    </p>
<p>
      Several times during the night Nella inquired for her father, but could
      gain no knowledge of his whereabouts. Now, at half-past six in the
      morning, a rumour had mysteriously spread among the servants of the hotel
      about the happenings of the night before. How it had originated no one
      could have determined, but it had originated.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Where is my father?’ Nella asked of Hans.
    </p>
<p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, and pointed upwards. ‘Somewhere at the top,
      they say.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella almost ran out of the room. Her interruption of the interview
      between Jules and Theodore Racksole has already been described. As she
      came downstairs with her father she said again, ‘Prince Eugen is dying—but
      I think you can save him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I?’ exclaimed Theodore.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ she repeated positively. ‘I will tell you what I want you to do,
      and you must do it.’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Twenty-Nine THEODORE IS CALLED TO THE RESCUE
    </h2>
<p>
      AS Nella passed downstairs from the top storey with her father—the
      lifts had not yet begun to work—she drew him into her own room, and
      closed the door.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What’s this all about?’ he asked, somewhat mystified, and even alarmed by
      the extreme seriousness of her face.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dad,’ the girl began, ‘you are very rich, aren’t you? very, very rich?’
      She smiled anxiously, timidly. He did not remember to have seen that
      expression on her face before. He wanted to make a facetious reply, but
      checked himself.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I am. You ought to know that by this time.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How soon could you realize a million pounds?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A million—what?’ he cried. Even he was staggered by her calm
      reference to this gigantic sum. ‘What on earth are you driving at?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A million pounds, I said. That is to say, five million dollars. How soon
      could you realize as much as that?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Oh!’ he answered, ‘in about a month, if I went about it neatly enough. I
      could unload as much as that in a month without scaring Wall Street and
      other places. But it would want some arrangement.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Useless!’ she exclaimed. ‘Couldn’t you do it quicker, if you really had
      to?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If I really had to, I could fix it in a week, but it would make things
      lively, and I should lose on the job.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Couldn’t you,’ she persisted, ‘couldn’t you go down this morning and
      raise a million, somehow, if it was a matter of life and death?’
    </p>
<p>
      He hesitated. ‘Look here, Nella,’ he said, ‘what is it you’ve got up your
      sleeve?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just answer my question, Dad, and try not to think that I’m a stark,
      staring lunatic.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I rather expect I could get a million this morning, even in London. But
      it would cost pretty dear. It might cost me fifty thousand pounds, and
      there would be the dickens of an upset in New York—a sort of grand
      universal slump in my holdings.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why should New York know anything about it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why should New York know anything about it!’ he repeated. ‘My girl, when
      anyone borrows a million sovereigns the whole world knows about it. Do you
      reckon that I can go up to the Governors of the Bank of England and say,
      “Look here, lend Theodore Racksole a million for a few weeks, and he’ll
      give you an IOU and a covering note on stocks”?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you could get it?’ she asked again.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If there’s a million in London I guess I could handle it,’ he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well, Dad,’ and she put her arms round his neck, ‘you’ve just got to go
      out and fix it. See? It’s for me. I’ve never asked you for anything really
      big before. But I do now. And I want it so badly.’
    </p>
<p>
      He stared at her. ‘I award you the prize,’ he said, at length. ‘You
      deserve it for colossal and immense coolness. Now you can tell me the true
      inward meaning of all this rigmarole. What is it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want it for Prince Eugen,’ she began, at first hesitatingly, with
      pauses.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘He’s ruined unless he can get a million to pay off his debts. He’s
      dreadfully in love with a Princess, and he can’t marry her because of
      this.
    </p>
<p>
      Her parents wouldn’t allow it. He was to have got it from Sampson Levi,
      but he arrived too late—owing to Jules.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I know all about that—perhaps more than you do. But I don’t see how
      it affects you or me.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The point is this, Dad,’ Nella continued. ‘He’s tried to commit suicide—he’s
      so hipped. Yes, real suicide. He took laudanum last night. It didn’t kill
      him straight off—he’s got over the first shock, but he’s in a very
      weak state, and he means to die. And I truly believe he will die. Now, if
      you could let him have that million, Dad, you would save his life.’
    </p>
<p>
      Nella’s item of news was a considerable and disconcerting surprise to
      Racksole, but he hid his feelings fairly well.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I haven’t the least desire to save his life, Nell. I don’t overmuch
      respect your Prince Eugen. I’ve done what I could for him—but only
      for the sake of seeing fair play, and because I object to conspiracies and
      secret murders.
    </p>
<p>
      It’s a different thing if he wants to kill himself. What I say is: Let
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      Who is responsible for his being in debt to the tune of a million pounds?
      He’s only got himself and his bad habits to thank for that. I suppose if
      he does happen to peg out, the throne of Posen will go to Prince Aribert.
      And a good thing, too! Aribert is worth twenty of his nephew.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That’s just it, Dad,’ she said, eagerly following up her chance. ‘I want
      you to save Prince Eugen just because Aribert—Prince Aribert—doesn’t
      wish to occupy the throne. He’d much prefer not to have it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Much prefer not to have it! Don’t talk nonsense. If he’s honest with
      himself, he’ll admit that he’ll be jolly glad to have it. Thrones are in
      his blood, so to speak.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You are wrong, Father. And the reason is this: If Prince Aribert ascended
      the throne of Posen he would be compelled to marry a Princess.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well! A Prince ought to marry a Princess.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But he doesn’t want to. He wants to give up all his royal rights, and
      live as a subject. He wants to marry a woman who isn’t a Princess.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Is she rich?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Her father is,’ said the girl. ‘Oh, Dad! can’t you guess? He—he
      loves me.’ Her head fell on Theodore’s shoulder and she began to cry.
    </p>
<p>
      The millionaire whistled a very high note. ‘Nell!’ he said at length. ‘And
      you? Do you sort of cling to him?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Dad,’ she answered, ‘you are stupid. Do you imagine I should worry myself
      like this if I didn’t?’ She smiled through her tears. She knew from her
      father’s tone that she had accomplished a victory.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘It’s a mighty queer arrangement,’ Theodore remarked. ‘But of course if
      you think it’ll be of any use, you had better go down and tell your Prince
      Eugen that that million can be fixed up, if he really needs it. I expect
      there’ll be decent security, or Sampson Levi wouldn’t have mixed himself
      up in it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Thanks, Dad. Don’t come with me; I may manage better alone.’
    </p>
<p>
      She gave a formal little curtsey and disappeared. Racksole, who had the
      talent, so necessary to millionaires, of attending to several matters at
      once, the large with the small, went off to give orders about the
      breakfast and the remuneration of his assistant of the evening before, Mr
      George Hazell. He then sent an invitation to Mr Felix Babylon’s room,
      asking that gentleman to take breakfast with him. After he had related to
      Babylon the history of Jules’ capture, and had a long discussion with him
      upon several points of hotel management, and especially as to the guarding
      of wine-cellars, Racksole put on his hat, sallied forth into the Strand,
      hailed a hansom, and was driven to the City. The order and nature of his
      operations there were too complex and technical to be described here.
    </p>
<p>
      When Nella returned to the State bedroom both the doctor and the great
      specialist were again in attendance. The two physicians moved away from
      the bedside as she entered, and began to talk quietly together in the
      embrasure of the window.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘A curious case!’ said the specialist.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Yes. Of course, as you say, it’s a neurotic temperament that’s at the
      bottom of the trouble. When you’ve got that and a vigorous constitution
      working one against the other, the results are apt to be distinctly
      curious.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you consider there is any hope, Sir Charles?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If I had seen him when he recovered consciousness I should have said
      there was hope. Frankly, when I left last night, or rather this morning, I
      didn’t expect to see the Prince alive again—let alone conscious, and
      able to talk. According to all the rules of the game, he ought to get over
      the shock to the system with perfect ease and certainty. But I don’t think
      he will. I don’t think he wants to. And moreover, I think he is still
      under the influence of suicidal mania. If he had a razor he would cut his
      throat. You must keep his strength up. Inject, if necessary. I will come
      in this afternoon. I am due now at St James’s Palace.’ And the specialist
      hurried away, with an elaborate bow and a few hasty words of polite
      reassurances to Prince Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      When he had gone Prince Aribert took the other doctor aside. ‘Forget
      everything, doctor,’ he said, ‘except that I am one man and you are
      another, and tell me the truth. Shall you be able to save his Highness?
      Tell me the truth.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘There is no truth,’ was the doctor’s reply. ‘The future is not in our
      hands, Prince.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But you are hopeful? Yes or no.’
    </p>
<p>
      The doctor looked at Prince Aribert. ‘No!’ he said shortly. ‘I am not. I
      am never hopeful when the patient is not on my side.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You mean—?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean that his Royal Highness has no desire to live. You must have
      observed that.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Only too well,’ said Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And you are aware of the cause?’
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert nodded an affirmative.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But cannot remove it?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘No,’ said Aribert. He felt a touch on his sleeve. It was Nella’s finger.
    </p>
<p>
      With a gesture she beckoned him towards the ante-room.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If you choose,’ she said, when they were alone, ‘Prince Eugen can be
      saved.
    </p>
<p>
      I have arranged it.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You have arranged it?’ He bent over her, almost with an air of alarm. ‘Go
      and tell him that the million pounds which is so necessary to his
      happiness will be forthcoming. Tell him that it will be forthcoming today,
      if that will be any satisfaction to him.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But what do you mean by this, Nella?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I mean what I say, Aribert,’ and she sought his hand and took it in hers.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Just what I say. If a million pounds will save Prince Eugen’s life, it is
      at his disposal.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But how—how have you managed it? By what miracle?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘My father,’ she replied softly, ‘will do anything that I ask him. Do not
      let us waste time. Go and tell Eugen it is arranged, that all will be
      well.
    </p>
<p>
      Go!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But we cannot accept this—this enormous, this incredible favour. It
      is impossible.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Aribert,’ she said quickly, ‘remember you are not in Posen holding a
      Court reception. You are in England and you are talking to an American
      girl who has always been in the habit of having her own way.’
    </p>
<p>
      The Prince threw up his hands and went back in to the bedroom. The doctor
      was at a table writing out a prescription. Aribert approached the bedside,
      his heart beating furiously. Eugen greeted him with a faint, fatigued
      smile.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Eugen,’ he whispered, ‘listen carefully to me. I have news. With the
      assistance of friends I have arranged to borrow that million for you. It
      is quite settled, and you may rely on it. But you must get better. Do you
      hear me?’
    </p>
<p>
      Eugen almost sat up in bed. ‘Tell me I am not delirious,’ he exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Of course you aren’t,’ Aribert replied. ‘But you mustn’t sit up. You must
      take care of yourself.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Who will lend the money?’ Eugen asked in a feeble, happy whisper.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Never mind. You shall hear later. Devote yourself now to getting better.’
    </p>
<p>
      The change in the patient’s face was extraordinary. His mind seemed to
      have put on an entirely different aspect. The doctor was startled to hear
      him murmur a request for food. As for Aribert, he sat down, overcome by
      the turmoil of his own thoughts. Till that moment he felt that he had
      never appreciated the value and the marvellous power of mere money, of the
      lucre which philosophers pretend to despise and men sell their souls for.
      His heart almost burst in its admiration for that extraordinary Nella, who
      by mere personal force had raised two men out of the deepest slough of
      despair to the blissful heights of hope and happiness. ‘These
      Anglo-Saxons,’ he said to himself, ‘what a race!’
    </p>
<p>
      By the afternoon Eugen was noticeably and distinctly better. The
      physicians, puzzled for the third time by the progress of the case,
      announced now that all danger was past. The tone of the announcement
      seemed to Aribert to imply that the fortunate issue was due wholly to
      unrivalled medical skill, but perhaps Aribert was mistaken. Anyhow, he was
      in a most charitable mood, and prepared to forgive anything.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nella,’ he said a little later, when they were by themselves again in the
      ante-chamber, ‘what am I to say to you? How can I thank you? How can I
      thank your father?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You had better not thank my father,’ she said. ‘Dad will affect to regard
      the thing as a purely business transaction, as, of course, it is. As for
      me, you can—you can—’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Well?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Kiss me,’ she said. ‘There! Are you sure you’ve formally proposed to me,
      mon prince?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! Nell!’ he exclaimed, putting his arms round her again. ‘Be mine! That
      is all I want!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You’ll find,’ she said, ‘that you’ll want Dad’s consent too!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Will he make difficulties? He could not, Nell—not with you!’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Better ask him,’ she said sweetly.
    </p>
<p>
      A moment later Racksole himself entered the room. ‘Going on all right?’ he
      enquired, pointing to the bedroom. ‘Excellently,’ the lovers answered
      together, and they both blushed.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah!’ said Racksole. ‘Then, if that’s so, and you can spare a minute, I’ve
      something to show you, Prince.’
    </p>

<h2>
      Chapter Thirty CONCLUSION
    </h2>
<p>
      ‘I’VE a great deal to tell you, Prince,’ Racksole began, as soon as they
      were out of the room, ‘and also, as I said, something to show you. Will
      you come to my room? We will talk there first. The whole hotel is humming
      with excitement.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘With pleasure,’ said Aribert.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Glad his Highness Prince Eugen is recovering,’ Racksole said, urged by
      considerations of politeness.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Ah! As to that—’ Aribert began. ‘If you don’t mind, we’ll discuss
      that later, Prince,’ Racksole interrupted him.
    </p>
<p>
      They were in the proprietor’s private room.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I want to tell you all about last night,’ Racksole resumed, ‘about my
      capture of Jules, and my examination of him this morning.’ And he launched
      into a full account of the whole thing, down to the least details. ‘You
      see,’ he concluded, ‘that our suspicions as to Bosnia were tolerably
      correct. But as regards Bosnia, the more I think about it, the surer I
      feel that nothing can be done to bring their criminal politicians to
      justice.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And as to Jules, what do you propose to do?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Come this way,’ said Racksole, and led Aribert to another room. A sofa in
      this room was covered with a linen cloth. Racksole lifted the cloth—he
      could never deny himself a dramatic moment—and disclosed the body of
      a dead man.
    </p>
<p>
      It was Jules, dead, but without a scratch or mark on him.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I have sent for the police—not a street constable, but an official
      from Scotland Yard,’ said Racksole.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How did this happen?’ Aribert asked, amazed and startled. ‘I understood
      you to say that he was safely immured in the bedroom.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So he was,’ Racksole replied. ‘I went up there this afternoon, chiefly to
      take him some food. The commissionaire was on guard at the door. He had
      heard no noise, nothing unusual. Yet when I entered the room Jules was
      gone.
    </p>
<p>
      He had by some means or other loosened his fastenings; he had then managed
      to take the door off the wardrobe. He had moved the bed in front of the
      window, and by pushing the wardrobe door three parts out of the window and
      lodging the inside end of it under the rail at the head of the bed, he had
      provided himself with a sort of insecure platform outside the window. All
      this he did without making the least sound. He must then have got through
      the window, and stood on the little platform. With his fingers he would
      just be able to reach the outer edge of the wide cornice under the roof of
      the hotel. By main strength of arms he had swung himself on to this
      cornice, and so got on to the roof proper. He would then have the run of
      the whole roof.
    </p>
<p>
      At the side of the building facing Salisbury Lane there is an iron
      fire-escape, which runs right down from the ridge of the roof into a
      little sunk yard level with the cellars. Jules must have thought that his
      escape was accomplished. But it unfortunately happened that one rung in
      the iron escape-ladder had rusted rotten through being badly painted. It
      gave way, and Jules, not expecting anything of the kind, fell to the
      ground. That was the end of all his cleverness and ingenuity.’
    </p>
<p>
      As Racksole ceased, speaking he replaced the linen cloth with a gesture
      from which reverence was not wholly absent.
    </p>
<p>
      When the grave had closed over the dark and tempestuous career of Tom
      Jackson, once the pride of the Grand Babylon, there was little trouble for
      the people whose adventures we have described. Miss Spencer, that
      yellow-haired, faithful slave and attendant of a brilliant scoundrel, was
      never heard of again. Possibly to this day she survives, a mystery to her
      fellow-creatures, in the pension of some cheap foreign boarding-house. As
      for Rocco, he certainly was heard of again. Several years after the events
      set down, it came to the knowledge of Felix Babylon that the unrivalled
      Rocco had reached Buenos Aires, and by his culinary skill was there making
      the fortune of a new and splendid hotel. Babylon transmitted the
      information to Theodore Racksole, and Racksole might, had he chosen, have
      put the forces of the law in motion against him. But Racksole, seeing that
      everything pointed to the fact that Rocco was now pursuing his vocation
      honestly, decided to leave him alone. The one difficulty which Racksole
      experienced after the demise of Jules—and it was a difficulty which
      he had, of course, anticipated—was connected with the police. The
      police, very properly, wanted to know things. They desired to be informed
      what Racksole had been doing in the Dimmock affair, between his first
      visit to Ostend and his sending for them to take charge of Jules’ dead
      body. And Racksole was by no means inclined to tell them everything.
      Beyond question he had transgressed the laws of England, and possibly also
      the laws of Belgium; and the moral excellence of his motives in doing so
      was, of course, in the eyes of legal justice, no excuse for such conduct.
      The inquest upon Jules aroused some bother; and about ninety-and-nine
      separate and distinct rumours. In the end, however, a compromise was
      arrived at. Racksole’s first aim was to pacify the inspector whose clue,
      which by the way was a false one, he had so curtly declined to follow up.
      That done, the rest needed only tact and patience. He proved to the
      satisfaction of the authorities that he had acted in a perfectly honest
      spirit, though with a high hand, and that substantial justice had been
      done. Also, he subtly indicated that, if it came to the point, he should
      defy them to do their worst. Lastly, he was able, through the medium of
      the United States Ambassador, to bring certain soothing influences to bear
      upon the situation.

      One afternoon, a fortnight after the recovery of the Hereditary Prince of
      Posen, Aribert, who was still staying at the Grand Babylon, expressed a
      wish to hold converse with the millionaire. Prince Eugen, accompanied by
      Hans and some Court officials whom he had sent for, had departed with
      immense éclat, armed with the comfortable million, to arrange formally for
      his betrothal.
    </p>
<p>
      Touching the million, Eugen had given satisfactory personal security, and
      the money was to be paid off in fifteen years.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You wish to talk to me, Prince,’ said Racksole to Aribert, when they were
      seated together in the former’s room.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I wish to tell you,’ replied Aribert, ‘that it is my intention to
      renounce all my rights and titles as a Royal Prince of Posen, and to be
      known in future as Count Hartz—a rank to which I am entitled through
      my mother.
    </p>
<p>
      Also that I have a private income of ten thousand pounds a year, and a
      château and a town house in Posen. I tell you this because I am here to
      ask the hand of your daughter in marriage. I love her, and I am vain
      enough to believe that she loves me. I have already asked her to be my
      wife, and she has consented. We await your approval.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘You honour us, Prince,’ said Racksole with a slight smile, ‘and in more
      ways than one. May I ask your reason for renouncing your princely titles?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Simply because the idea of a morganatic marriage would be as repugnant to
      me as it would be to yourself and to Nella.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘That is good.’ The Prince laughed. ‘I suppose it has occurred to you that
      ten thousand pounds per annum, for a man in your position, is a somewhat
      small income. Nella is frightfully extravagant. I have known her to spend
      sixty thousand dollars in a single year, and have nothing to show for it
      at the end. Why! she would ruin you in twelve months.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Nella must reform her ways,’ Aribert said.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘If she is content to do so,’ Racksole went on, ‘well and good! I
      consent.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘In her name and my own, I thank you,’ said Aribert gravely.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And,’ the millionaire continued, ‘so that she may not have to reform too
      fiercely, I shall settle on her absolutely, with reversion to your
      children, if you have any, a lump sum of fifty million dollars, that is to
      say, ten million pounds, in sound, selected railway stock. I reckon that
      is about half my fortune. Nella and I have always shared equally.’
    </p>
<p>
      Aribert made no reply. The two men shook hands in silence, and then it
      happened that Nella entered the room.
    </p>
<p>
      That night, after dinner, Racksole and his friend Felix Babylon were
      walking together on the terrace of the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel.
    </p>
<p>
      Felix had begun the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I suppose, Racksole,’ he had said, ‘you aren’t getting tired of the Grand
      Babylon?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Why do you ask?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Because I am getting tired of doing without it. A thousand times since I
      sold it to you I have wished I could undo the bargain. I can’t bear
      idleness. Will you sell?’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘I might,’ said Racksole, ‘I might be induced to sell.’
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What will you take, my friend?’ asked Felix
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What I gave,’ was the quick answer.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Eh!’ Felix exclaimed. ‘I sell you my hotel with Jules, with Rocco, with
      Miss Spencer. You go and lose all those three inestimable servants, and
      then offer me the hotel without them at the same price! It is monstrous.’
      The little man laughed heartily at his own wit. ‘Nevertheless,’ he added,
      ‘we will not quarrel about the price. I accept your terms.’
    </p>
<p>
      And so was brought to a close the complex chain of events which had begun
      when Theodore Racksole ordered a steak and a bottle of Bass at the table
      d’hÃ´te of the Grand Babylon HÃ´tel.
